</code></pre><p>The small Jewish town was spread out like an old forgotten, extinguished ruin. Not a soul could be seen passing through the slushy streets on that snowy evening.  Only one light shone brightly in the large dusty, wind-blown station – the lone evidence of human habitation.  Several lamps were lit in the depot. The train personnel, recognizable only by the metal badge on their hats, sprawled drowsing on the benches.  </p>
<p>In the midst of the cavernous, empty station, among bits of straw and strewn garbage, stood a few Jews with creased and ragged beards, wearing muddied caftans and speaking in hurried tones, which echoed back off the bare walls of the station. There was still half an hour until the train was due.  Every minute or so, another Jew entered, carrying sacks and bundles.  As usual, they asked each other if and when the train would appear.  They studied their watches, milled around aimlessly or simply sat, waiting.</p>
<p>The round door of the ticket counter was closed; nonetheless the passengers began to line up in single file.  The first person in line, Reb Wolf, was an agile Jew, his hat pushed back on his head at a jaunty angle.  He stood fussing with his money on the closed counter ledge, quietly without haste, constantly checking his watch.</p>
<p>“Jews,” he said, “I am afraid that we won’t be able to depart…it’s already late, and the person in charge is still not at the ticket counter…”
“What do you mean?  Is it possible?  Perhaps he is doing this on purpose, so that we won’t be able to travel!  We must do something.  Perhaps ask the station master!”
“Vay, vay, woe unto us.”
“It is spite…the passengers here are all Jews!  If there were only one gentile, a land-owner, a military man…that would surely teach them!”
“It is possible that he sees only ‘zshidkes’ (Jewboys)….so what does he care?”
“Reb Wolf, don’t be afraid, bang loudly upon the door, the way you should!  Perhaps he is even sleeping in there, the ‘prince’…tell him that it is late!”
“Why ask me to bang?  You can bang on the door as well!  Smart guy…”
“Let me through!  I am a ‘regular’”, said a young, long-nosed man in a high hat.</p>
<p>The quiet murmuring suddenly became a roar.  The gentile train workers, still half asleep, rubbed their eyes, scratched their hair, and claimed they knew nothing.</p>
<p>All at once, a Jew came running towards them with the news.  The crowd encircled him at once, and he reported that there - pointing to the dark section of the hall, near the empty ‘buffet’ – there! The cashier was sitting with Yankele Mekler – playing chess!
The whole group rushed over to them, chattering noisily.  And there they did indeed see the cashier, crouched over a chess board, deep in thought.  Across from him sat Yankele Mekler, his hat perched at a rakish angle, side curls hanging down, grasping his beard and singing a sad, Yom Kippur prayer tune.</p>
<p>The Jews stood off to the side.  They didn’t have the nerve to interrupt the cashier’s concentrated play.  They simply mumbled quietly among themselves:</p>
<p>“Vay, vay, what a gentile can get himself into…”
“He’s so concerned, that he doesn’t realize what’s going on around him.”
“In any case, gentlemen, I believe I hear the train coming.  I must go!”</p>
<p>They approached the two players, and one of the group called out quietly:</p>
<p>“Yankl…yehudi…let go of the ‘prince’!”</p>
<p>And they began to mimic with their hands and eyes, showing in various ways that it was time to go, that he must take leave of the cashier.
“Please, mister, tickets!” they begged.
But who?  What?  It was of no use!  Neither the cashier nor Yankl heard or saw a thing.
Yankl began a new nigun (melody) – of the ‘Modzsitser’ Rebbe, and the gentile muttered along.
“Yankl, for goodness sake!” they cried. </p>
<p>Then the Jews began to come closer, step by step, quietly, like goats stealthily approaching the neighbor’s hay.  They encircled the two players, and seeing the chess board, realized that the cashier was in a most unfortunate situation.  He came in with his queen between Yankl’s two horses, a pawn and a rook. The gentile creased his brow and scratched.  He kept grabbing the queen, but could not find a way to protect her.</p>
<p>“The ‘prince’ has had it!” Reb Wolf declared.
“The poor queen is…..” added a second.</p>
<p>And before anyone knew it, someone ‘caught’ Yankl’s tune.  The Jews forgot that they must depart and travel in order to earn a living.  They waited to see what the gentile would do without a queen.  For a few minutes they joined together, beards over the chess board, singing one ‘nigun’ after another, swaying interspersed with a cough or a moan.  And when Yankl, with a new move, removed the queen from the board, they burst out with a new ‘zemer’ – a lusty tune, which prompted the cashier to jump up and cry:<br>“Out of here! Now!”</p>
<p>Only then did they hear the whistle from afar.</p>
<p>The train had already left the station…..  </p>
