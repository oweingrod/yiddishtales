<p>In the large central room of the old house it was always cold, both in summer and winter.
There seemed to be an empty, meaningless wind blowing through, carrying with it a scent of ‘long-ago’, of old people, long gone. It felt as though someone had run away, never to return.</p>
<p>
A large, heavy table stood surrounded by cracked and overstuffed stools, a broken piano in the corner. On the walls two very large pictures hung side by side: an enlarged photograph of an elderly Jew in a <em>yarmulke</em> ( a skullcap ) with a round white beard.  The second picture portrayed a woman with a large brooch under her heavy, double-chinned goiter. These were the past owners of the house, from long ago. The man has been dead these many years, killed during the storm of war and soon forgotten. All signs of him have disappeared, along with the dramatic events of those mad times. Sons, sons-in-law and family – all went off to war.  Daughters were married in haste, to grooms already in military uniforms – scared young men, decent boys who had been around the house for years, and then, suddenly, were whisked away in the end, as if by an angry wind.</p>
<p>
All that is left of the old homeowners are the pictures of the deceased man, and the still-living woman, who continued to roam about the kitchen.  She is small and shrunken, with dull, half-closed eyes.
</p>
<p>
She herself cannot say how she has managed to stay alive all these years. How many people had passed through these rooms, strangers and relatives alike. To this very day, strangers still reside in the many side rooms. The current owners of the house are the two daughters – the eldest, Sara, who returned from Russia, widowed with an eight-year-old daughter; and Bella, the youngest daughter and her husband.
</p>
<p>
Various tenants  inhabited the side rooms of the large six-flat house. From one part of the house a telephone rang, from another room a radio blasts, the sounds of people walking around were heard, a servant’s stirrings, children playing.  But none of this reaches the large, cold, impermeable central room. </p>
<p>
Friends come to see the eighteen-year-old <em>fraulein</em> (young woman), others visit with the  other tenants, but as the old woman’s wanderings are mostly limited to the kitchen, she is unaware of these affairs. She only has arguments with the servant. Her head bent low, she cannot understand why she is still here. She knows every corner of the place, and believes that she was born here.  Only when she sees her eldest daughter Sara, the widow, does she vaguely remember a past life. Her daughter begins to look more and more like her, and both talk about things that others no longer remember. They speak of their husbands, and of people who once lived there, and no one seems to understand who they are talking about. </p>
<p>
However, sometimes, during a <em>yomtov</em> ( a holiday),– a ringing or knocking is heard at the door and there appears an old <em>Yid</em> or a <em>Yidene</em> (Jew or Jewess). At first, the servant is sure these are alms-seekers, looking for charity. Out come the children of the youngest daughter, gazing upon these outsiders with curiosity and fear. Then the young son-in-law and the eldest daughter come to the door and carefully look the old people over, who do not ask for money.  They wish to see someone, they claim, and after a long while, all becomes clear: Aha, this is perhaps a visitor for the old one, for their mother!
The old woman comes out, looking long and hard through her dulled, hazy eyes.  Suddenly, a red flush of color suffuses her creased face, and a tear is seen, etched among the deep seams of her cheeks. </p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Oy, Ethel, this is really Ethel, the <em>bobe</em> (grandmother) Dreizel’s daughter!”</p>
<p>
The two old people fall upon each other, entwined like two monkeys. Their gnarled hands rock back and forth, smoothing and embracing the dry-skinned limbs. And they weep.</p>
<p>
The young, unfamiliar ones leave the room, excitedly. The old woman leads her guest into the large, cold central room, where they sit down, legs dangling, on the overstuffed stools. They talk, and their words awaken old names, sayings and images.</p>
<p>
The older guest points with a wrinkled finger to the picture on the wall.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“And who is this? ...Sha, just a second, this is actually your Yossl…yes, it’s really Yossl!  I see him as if he was alive!”</p>
<p>
The old woman nods her head.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“And this is you, Shifra, yes!  How long ago was this?  Oy vay!”</p>
<p>
The old woman nods her head once more.</p>
<p>And thus they sit for a long while…until it grows dark.</p>
<p>
The old woman brings some refreshments – tea, and sweets that she hides away, taking them out for visitors only. Her face flushes with shame…she has no baked goods. Who can be bothered with such things now?</p>
<p>The nearby rooms are noisy. Guests come and go; some are preparing to go to the movies. But here in the center room, no one enters. Telephone conversations are heard, appointments are made; here and there electric light is glimpsed from the nearby rooms.</p>
<p>
But here it is dark. The old people sit, their voices becoming warmer, younger.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door opens. Sara, the oldest daughter, comes in. A renewed recognition and conversation begins.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Sarah. This is my Sarah, the eldest….don’t you remember Sorele? This is Ethel, Ethel – the Baba Dreizel’s…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“I was actually at your wedding…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
Sarah begins nodding her head: “Of course, of course!”</p>
<p>And in the deep darkness of the old house, once again is heard an old, forgotten
“God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob”…</p>
