<p>THE BATH HOUSE 
DI BOD
 E. Kaganovski</p>
<p>The conversation took place in the baths, midst a thick cloud of steam where a dozen or so naked men wandered about, reminiscent of the pictures of Jews working as slaves for Pharaoh in Egypt.
All these naked people walked around slowly, with careful crooked steps on the wet slippery stone floor, busy with pitchers, jumping to and fro, carrying small vessels, shmates (cloth rags) or little brushes. Some would suddenly,  with loud cries, begin to thrash themselves on their sides or backs, as though a swarm of flies had attacked them.
There were Jews with thin, bluish feet and skinny shoulders like fragile Succot booths, put up hastily with thin wood. There were also a couple of gentile bath keepers, who would suddenly fall upon one or another of the nude Jews - laid out on the benches like corpses on a slab – whereupon they began with vigor to knead, punch, and scrape, while pouring steaming water over the pale bodies.
Among the various rinsings and sighings emanating from the warm steam room, two voices were heard: one spoke in a piercing tone with a shriek at the end of each word, while the second answered with a shallow, muttering rasp that came from a mighty belly. The one with the piercing voice lay on the upper bench.  One could barely make out his thin, yellow hands and his small, pale red-bearded face.  The second sat below, waiting for a pitcher. He held his large belly, which looked like a pink sack of flour, in his arms.   His hair was thin and grey, his face strong and serious.  Amidst the moisture of the baths, their conversation echoed strangely, as if heard through the telephone.
“Aha? Do you see this stomach now?...Half of what it was…because I take care of myself…I don’t eat cholent (a traditional, rich Sabbath stew) anymore…the main thing is…I no longer drink beer…because beer pushes out the belly…do you hear? Beer blows one up. I used to sit down and eat half a duck, you hear? a whole fish, and wash it down with a few beers.  Now I restrain myself - only white meat, it doesn’t really satisfy.  A chicken for such a “personage” like me is like a spit in the ocean.  What can one expect from a chicken?  A fairy! That’s what they want – these doctors, and they - they gorge themselves! Ha??”
The yellowish one moved suddenly and answered in a shrieking voice:
“I say eating is a small detail.  A Jew needn’t eat a lot…just enough to maintain the soul.  As my zeide (grandfather) used to say: ‘The kishke (stomach) is a fool’…ha, ha, ha…oh , that burns.”
Thus, the discussion continued about stomachs, about thinness, about health and food, and about cures like bankes (cupping glasses). Finally, the bellied man let out a great yawn and suddenly asked:
“So, what will be with the few Jews that are left?”
“Oy vay! It’s bad.”
“Well, you hear talk of Eretz Yisroel (the Land of Israel).”
“Nu, yes, nu…”
Later, the fat man wrapped a towel around his head, went down on all fours, performed a strange dance complete with sighs, groans, coughing and sneezing, and continued the conversation:
“Do you hear me?  What do you say, should we ask the bath keeper to bring us a bottle of beer? Or should I listen to the doctor?  I am so thirsty…”
The other man simply answered with a groan and the fat man continued: 
“I tell you, in the old days no one knew about restrictions.  A man had a belly, and – on the contrary – he commanded respect!  They doffed their hats!  Who had a belly? The landlord!  A thin person was an ‘underling’.
But today, if one has a belly, one runs to the doctor, and  what does that lead to? The women too.  They look for a fairy!  My wife was a hearty eater, a ‘czarina’ – when she walked, the walls would shake – and then she began to drink vinegar, felt shaky, and became thin like a stick, do you hear?
I dislike a thin woman…what do you say?”
“What should I say?  My trade is a box-maker…”
“So how is your business? Do you earn any money?”
“Money, I don’t see.”
“Money…money is a delicate thing…”
“Oy vay…”
“Tell me, what’s going on with America?  Are Jews going there, or not?”
“You want to go to America?”
“Me? Go? What for - to be miserable? To work like a horse? Please, hand me the pitcher…”
“And will there be a war?”
“A war?
The yellowish man carefully lowered his thin legs down from the upper bench, and sighed deeply.
“Wars, decrees - everything in order to choke the Jews. Please, could you lend me your brush?  Woe is me.  Oy! The steam isn’t what it used to be.”
“Ah, yes, there’s nothing like that old time steam…”</p>
