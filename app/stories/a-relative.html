    I lay on my wide couch, book in hand, with the oven radiating warmth. I was about to drink a glass of tea, when I heard a knock at the door. A minute
    later, the maid entered and explained:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Ah… well… a woman.”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “A woman?” I repeated.
</p>
<p>
    Now every woman who comes to me is known beforehand. I know the hour…even the minute of her arrival. Today, however, I was awaiting no one.
</p>
<p>
    I went into the front room, and there was, in fact, a woman. The servant was carrying her small valise behind her.
</p>
<p>
    Before I had enough time to recognize her, she threw her arms around me, and suffusing me with powder and cologne, gave me a kiss with cold, frozen lips.
</p>
<p>
    Only at that instant did I recognize the lovely Rayzel, a distant relative of mine, from the provinces.
</p>
<p>
    Holding her arm, I took her into my room, put her things down and, in a split second, I remembered our unconsummated love affair of many years ago, in the
    public gardens – the moonlit nights, the long walks, the stolen kisses which, like all good things, fade away and hardly ever return.
</p>
<p>
    After this, once Rayzel had removed her coat and hat, she took my place on the couch in order to rest; later, as her rosy provincial face with blooming
    cheeks began to glow from the warmth – I began to enjoy looking at her.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, Rayzel, the lovely Rayzel. But she no longer looked the same, no more shyly stolen glances full of promise. I saw that she had become older and more
    mature, as she gave me a direct questioning look and spoke to me with breathless, lilting laughter.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Nu, do you still love me? You had been somewhat in love once upon a time….”, she said playfully.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Not just a little…”, I mumbled.
</p>
<p>
    And I began to feel a bit foolish in response to her questioning. I was afraid that she would soon begin to speak, in her high, laughing voice, of our
    kisses; but she seemed not to recall them at all.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    After supper, when we had spoken about everything and I had received regards from all those we knew in our home town, I began to realize that Rayzel was
    now a grown woman. She spoke freely, with the exaggerated openness of a grown country girl, who was afraid of being ignored. I had already arranged with my
    landlady to allow Rayzel to stay the night in the second bedroom. The landlady was trying to find out who she was – perhaps actually a bride-to-be, or even
    a wife??
</p>
<p>
    She began to wink at me with piercing eyes. The servant also began speaking to me with a wink, and I knew there would be no rest for me now. I kept
    thinking that Rayzel had come for me. I quickly forgot about the many years during which I had not seen her. It seemed to me that the sweet hours of our
    young love with its many promises were only yesterday, and I was filled with a shuddering sense of expectation. I imagined that Rayzel also waited
    impatiently for the moment when we would be alone - falling upon me with her feelings of pent-up longing. Something extraordinary was going to happen, I
    was sure.
</p>
<p>
    My landlady came in to meet my relative, and she was very friendly:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “With pleasure,” she said “you may sleep in the middle room. But during the day you may use the house, you needn’t feel cramped, you are a relative, after
    all”
</p>
<p>
    And Rayzel answered with a woman’s shrewd laughter, pointing to me:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Who takes ‘him’ into account? For me he is nobody.”
</p>
<p>
    I joined in the laughter, and sought out Rayzel’s glance, which I failed to catch.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Rayzel had been living with me for four days now. She slept in the next room, and I saw her only in the early morning, when she dressed behind my Spanish
    screen, asking me not to look or to leave the room. I hadn’t even had a chance to speak with her properly, she’d been so busy. She seemed to have business
    to attend to here in the city. She came home late at night, and had already been to several theaters.
</p>
<p>
    At night I waited for her. She came home late and was very careful about not letting me enter her room. I would lay awake in bed, plagued by the question
    of why and for whom had she come.
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    I had already postponed several visits, to which I was looking forward, because I didn’t want Rayzel to find me with a strange woman. But Rayzel was very
    busy. She dressed in new clothes every night, and quickly disappeared.
</p>
<p>
    Last night I finally went up and knocked at her door. It was quite late. Rayzel called out:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Who is it?”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “It’s me,” I whispered, “Rayzel?”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “What do you want now? So late?”
</p>
<p>
    An angry strangeness rang in her voice. And I suddenly realized that Rayzel’s visit had nothing to do with me. At the same time, I felt a heavy longing
    grip me. And I struggled through the night until morning…
</p>
<p>
    In the morning, as usual, Rayzel came into my room. She was in a great hurry and shouted:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Leave the room, I must change….”
</p>
<p>
    This time, however, I remained in the room while she changed behind the Spanish screen. This time she arranged the screen in a different way, such that I
    was able to see her almost completely. She was half-naked. I was sensitive to her wantonness. I felt that she was not doing this for me, that I was simply
    not a concern. I looked at her strong, naked arms and suddenly became aware of the whole uncomfortable situation of her visit. I then remembered that I
    must postpone a visit from one of my friends who was to come that evening.
</p>
<p>
    Rayzel dressed hurriedly. She then asked me about distant streets, about cafes and theaters, and I wondered at her competence regarding these various
    places, to which I seldom went.
</p>
<p>
    I waited to see if she would ask me about my visit to her door the other night, but she had apparently forgotten about it, or simply hadn’t given it a
    thought. Now I tried to engage her in conversation:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Rayzel, I wanted to have a little talk with you…but you are always so busy; you hardly have an hour to spare for me.”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “What would you like to talk to me about?” she asked indifferently, while putting on her blouse.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “I don’t know…I wanted to know what you think….”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “What I think?”
</p>
<p>
    She came up close to me, and for the first time took a good look at me with her old, winsome look. She leaned towards me:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “What, then, should I think?”
</p>
<p>
    A clean freshness emanated from her. A hot flood seemed to burst inside my head, and I wanted to take her in my arms and kiss her. But she was strong and
    easily managed to push me aside with one movement and jokingly say:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “What are you doing? This is impossible.”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “And back then it was possible?” I cried out, as the joke suddenly struck me.
</p>
<p>
    However, I still wanted an explanation about those long-ago days.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Those days?”
</p>
<p>
    Her gaze penetrated me with an expression of loneliness. My heart was pounding. This was the definitive moment.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Yes…back then, Rayzel. Don’t you remember? There was something between us.”
</p>
<p>
    She adjusted her stocking, thrusting her leg forward on the stool, revealing an area of smooth, white skin:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Ah…you still remember such foolishness?”
</p>
<p>
    I suddenly felt very unhappy. I approached her. I wanted finally to speak out and tell her, that for me, nothing had changed since those days; on the
    contrary, I now longed for her even more. Once more I wanted to see her head thrown back, her eyes closed. She now appeared to me wonderfully great and
    glorious. I didn’t dare embrace her.
</p>
<p>
    She took her handbag, and was soon out the door.
</p>
<p>
    Now it became completely clear that she had not come because of me. I walked up and down my room with mixed feelings. I thought that now, at this point, I
    had really lost Rayzel, and an angry outlook on the whole world descended upon me.
</p>
<p>
    Soon I heard a knock at my door, and the landlady came into my room. She looked at me with a shining face:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Your….your relative. Has already gone out?”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Yes,” I answered dryly.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “A pretty girl, like gold, she must have many acquaintances….”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “I don’t know….”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “I know…I see that she is entertaining, she goes out. It seems to me that she has come here to arrange a <em>shidukh</em> – a marriage….”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Who told you this?”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “No one.”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Has she perhaps spoken to you?”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “No, what are you talking about?”
</p>
<p>
    I didn’t know, but I answered:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Yes, about a <em>shidukh</em>, yes, of course, why not?”
</p>
<p>
    The landlady went out and I lay down on the couch and remained quite still until late afternoon. Lonely thoughts engulfed me, strange thoughts and plans. I
    thought about how
</p>
<p>
    I would tell Rayzel that I…Yes, I wanted to marry her; that I had long been in love with her. At the same time, I was upset by her womanly, albeit shallow,
    appeal.
</p>
<p>
    I will give her everything, I thought. I will sacrifice all for a single remembered look from her.
</p>
<p>
    In my fantasy she grew large, larger than life, and her white skin, which I saw in the morning, frightened me with evil strangeness.
</p>
<p>
    No, this was not the Rayzel that I knew.
</p>
<p>
    And yet, she continued to haunt me, as she had been, with her shy face; I felt the sweet mass of her hair on my shoulder. Until dark, I lay with a confused
    and thundering heart, until I heard her footsteps. She came into my room fresh and happy, with broad, healthy strides.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Why are you still lying around here?” she asked in her high voice.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Come here, Rayzel,” I said softly.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Why is it so dark?”
</p>
<p>
    She switched on the light and then came over to me. I took her by the hand, and with a hammering heart, I said quietly:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “Rayzel, I have something to tell you!” I cried out earnestly.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “I also want to tell you something,” she countered.
</p>
<p>
    My heart almost leaped from my chest.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “You tell me first.”
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “No, you tell me first, Rayzel.”
</p>
<p>
    She looked at me with that quiet, winsomely sweet look of hers and began:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
    “I wanted to ask if you would leave the house tomorrow for a few hours…I must meet someone here.”
</p>
<p>
    With that, she gave me a gentle pat on the head.
