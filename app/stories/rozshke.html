<p>The machines were happily clattering away in every corner of the large, square room.
The smaller rooms on the side were filled with ‘work’ – heavy stiff trousers for farmers or peasants and thick blue aprons and work shirts.  The darker front porch was enclosed and used as a kitchen, where Zelig’s wife, Golda, cooked all day. She is busy now, cheerfully cooking large quantities of food, and the kitchen crackles and steams with savory aromas that reach into all the corners of house and courtyard. </p>
<p>She cooks for the girls working at the machines, and for the apprentices in the small workshops in the courtyard – the mechanic, the men’s tailor and the bindery.
In addition, there are always old friends who drop in, as well as some of the unemployed parents of the young people who work there.</p>
<p>Golda’s eldest daughter, Etel the widow, had arrived from Paris with her daughter, Rozshke, and they occupied the furthest dismal alcove. The girl was fourteen years old and had just finished a Folkshule (school). She would often go out with boys and come home late. Her eyes seemed to gleam with silent longings. Every worn out corner of the large house was open, free for all to enter.  Especially on the shabbily neglected front porch, her curiosity was aroused by a few young men who grabbed her in the dark, wordlessly groping her and trying to find her barely budding breasts.</p>
<p>Rozshke began to feel new, warm emotions coursing through her. From the brief time  she lived with her mother in Paris, she learned a sort of trick that still remained with her — walking with her hips swaying and her chest thrust forward. She wanted desperately to grow up, so that she could understand the secret winks and hushed gossip of the girls at the machines. As soon as she finished school, she began to sew at one of the machines.</p>
<p>Zelig, already a grandfather at fifty-eight, was tireless, and mixed easily with the young people who hovered around him. Golda, his wife, with her cheerful personality, opened her door to all the crowded Jews of the courtyard.</p>
<p>The old Zelig had belonged to a “party” about thirty-five years before, for which he was banished to a far corner of Siberia. It was there that he learned many Russian words and phrases which, over time, became his rhyming watchwords. His revolutionary pride was preserved, and in his home there was always talk of the Workers’ Movement.</p>
<p>Old friends and comrades, worn out Jews, would come to Zelig’s house from time to time to discuss old times, and make fun of the ‘youngsters’.  Passionate arguments often broke out during those Sabbath evenings. In the dim corners of the old house sat pairs of youngsters. Lights were not turned on, and there, in the darkness they sang songs. The couples sitting in the dark were all the regular workers – both boys and girls.</p>
<p>On these evenings, Rozshke could simply not find a place for herself.  She would either go off to her girlfriends or fling herself down on her old, heavy bed in their dark room and sleep.  Her heart was pounding; her blood boiling.  Every song the young people sang pierced her skin, like thin, hot wires.</p>
<p>One Friday evening, Rozshke returned and entered the furthest  alcove where she lived with her mother. It was dark, and she was certain that no one was there. She felt, however, a living, breathing sound nearby, and in the next moment she saw a pair of men’s shoulders over her mother’s bed. She recognized the tailor’s helper – Wolf - who often came to visit.</p>
<p>Rozshke was distraught and didn’t know where to turn. She crawled down to sit upon a low stool near her bed, and buried her head in her hands. She heard the young man run off. He went into the large room nearby, and stood for a long while near a tall, dark window, breathing heavily. Her mother sighed, and suddenly, called out loudly:  “Rozshke…is that you?”</p>
<p>Rozshke did not answer. Her mother quickly rose from the bed, and Rozshke could see her straightening out her clothes in the darkness.  This took a long time. She then turned on the light.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Why are you so troubled?  Rozshke…why don’t you answer me..?” she asked.</p>
<p>Rozshke still did not answer. She simply could not utter a sound. She glanced at her mother, who hid her face and suddenly said:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“This…Wolf was sitting here. Plunked himself down and talked…spoke of the war…forgot to turn on a light…”</p>
<p>
Rozshke stood up. She stretched her hands high above her head, and all at once, ran out of the room.</p>
<p>She ran throughout the large dwelling where a small lamp was burning. She heard Zelig’s snoring and felt the damp breath of the youngsters concealing their loud laughter.
She ran out to the dark porch and leaned aganst the door. Bundles of old bedclothes and
straw sacks were strewn about. She felt peculiar, as if she were the only one in the world.</p>
<p>The broad shoulders of the apprentice, as they lay over her mother’s bed, obstructed her world, and her mother’s sighs aroused her in a troubling manner. In her mind, she felt that somehow her mother had died. She hurriedly opened the door and sat on the steps. A damp cold suddenly embraced her. She sat stark still on the dimly-lit,, muddy stairs. All at once she was reminded of the mechanic’s son, the youngster with the black forelocks under his hat –the one of whom she was always afraid. Now she suddenly remembered him, and thought that he would soon open the door of the dark house, and come for her.
And she wished he would come.</p>
<p>She had no idea what she would do if he were to appear, but she felt that she must perform a spiteful act. Once again she saw her mother’s bed, where her father had once slept. She was reminded of the time when she had gone on an outing with the Folkshule. Her mother had entertained a young man – his name was Yossel – and he would bring her sweets. He would spend a long time with her mother, and often remain long after Rozshke would go to sleep.</p>
<p>And a strong surge of blood pumped wildly in her heart.</p>
<hr>
<p>The house was strewn with rolls of cloth, scattered about in mute, swollen piles. Old Zelig unrolls the goods, cutting through them with a pair of long, squeaky scissors. New girls are working the machines now. Old Golda is cooking. Winter is coming, and the steam-covered door of the dark porch is always in motion.  New apprentices are at work, and even Etel the widow is now working.</p>
<p>Only the large workroom is brightly lit; the other two smaller rooms – one where the finished work lay in piles, and the other, where Etel and Rozshke live, are dark.
The lights in the large room have been strung together with thin rope and hang overhead, close to the machines. The machines clatter away, while the workers talk or sing.</p>
<p>Rozshke sews the sleeves onto large, thick shirts. This type of heavy shirt is worn by those who work and trade on the streets. She sits near a window at her machine and the noisy courtyard is seen through panes of glass. The opposite row of ‘offices’ and shops are sprinkled with small, dusty windows. Everywhere hands are moving, working the machines. But Rozshke hears something. She is drawn by a quiet sensation which takes her over - the dark stairs and corners and attics of the huge, impoverished narrow courtyard. It pulls her to the dark steps with their sweet secrets, and down the yard, to the cobblestone path – near the pasture where the milk man keeps his cows - where the straw grasses are seen, where the girls come to collect the milk, and the young men grab them off to --- what?...</p>
<p>
The strong odors of milk and cows surround her, awakening a strange tumult of emotion. She feels that she herself is a fresh dark clot of earth from which green grasses grow…she is drunk. She now knows everything: She knows that the young Wolf, the tailor’s apprentice, with his long nose and broad, red hands, comes to her mother, where they lay hidden in the dark room. No one disturbs them. </p>
<p class="dialogue">Grandfather Zelig often says to Golda:
“Golda, call Etel. Wolf has come!”</p>
<p> Rozshke is no longer curious about what they do together. She would simply like to escape from the dark, narrow room and never need to look at her mother’s bed. Not long ago, as she pretended to sleep, she heard her mother say to Wolf: “That girl is falling apart”</p>
<p>At the time, she had wanted desperately to talk with someone about this. But she had no one in whom to confide. She began to wish that she really would “fall apart”. At night, when she returned from the movies, she would wait long moments on the dark stairs, until the mechanic’s son would come. When she heard his steps on the stairs she would cry out, as if frightened:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Who is that?”</p>
<p>The young man came quickly to her side.  She smelled the odor of oil wafting up from his clothes, and his cold hands embraced her with wild energy. She was not afraid of him. She wanted more from him. But he suddenly stopped and said:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“But you are a working girl, a friend…”</p>
<p>Her hand lay listless on his arm. </p>
<hr>
<p>Soon, however, they began to meet several times a day. He came to see her in the large, noisy workroom. Rozshke did not lift her head. She only heard that he had asked to borrow a screwdriver.  And her grandfather Zelig had shouted derisively at him:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Tell me, you are such a mechanic that you don’t have a screwdriver?”</p>
<p>And the girls had all laughed.</p>
<p>Rozshke glanced up at his rumpled hair, and a warm sweetness overcame her.
Old Golda cried after him:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“We know what kind of a screwdriver you need…
you need the girl…but now is not the time…now we are working.”</p>
<p>Soon after, Rozshke got up and went out of the house.
The old one shouted after her:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Where are you off to Rozshke?  Are you going after the screwdriver?”</p>
<p>All the girls once more roared with laughter. One pinched another…</p>
<p>Rozshke went out onto the dusky courtyard.  There the young man waited, and they wordlessly embraced with all their might. She barely caught her breath, and returned to work.</p>
<p>From the many expressions and jibes, Rozshke realized that everyone in the house was aware of her situation, and she now understood that everyone did the same: that this was uppermost in everyone’s mind. The whole world spun around this thick, sweet notion that clung to and embraced everyone. The more she thought about it, the more she recalled many scenes of passion that had taken place in the corners of her mind. They seemed like hopeful promises of things to come.</p>
<p>A dreamy weariness came upon her.  Her arms pressed down across her bosom, and she barely made her way to the dark alcove, where she fell upon her bed and into a deep, hot sleep, again hugging herself with her legs tightly clutched together.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her mother would come in to wake her, fearfully:
“Rozshkele, why are you hiding like this?...In the middle of work?”</p>
<p>Rozshke did not answer. And her mother questioned her no further.</p>
<hr>
<p>
This was the day when no one worked. Everyone sat in the large room, the apprentices and the girls.  Old Zelig wore his favorite hat from the political party days, and went off with Wolf. These days it was well known that Etel was going to marry Wolf. Early that morning, Rozshke’s mother lay down beside her and began to speak to her about Wolf:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“You are already a grown-up girl…you must know …that I like this man…a woman cannot live alone her whole life…”</p>
<p>Rozshke lay with closed eyes. Her mother hugged her closely and her hands wandered over Rozshke’s skin. Rozshke’s heart was beating fast. Her mother’s touch reminded her of her last meeting with Leon, the mechanic’s son, on the stairs near the attic - the dark room on the third floor of the house. Her mind raced with the many words and accusations with which she could answer her mother. Where should she begin? Her skin shivered at her mother’s touch. Suddenly, Etel burst out:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“In a few years you will be a woman…..and you will understand everything.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“I already understand today…,” Rozshke replied in a sad, absent-minded voice.</p>
<p>Her mother held her, stared deeply into her eyes and said:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Going with a boy is fine…..but not so late at night…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rozshke snapped back angrily:  “What are you afraid of?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“That boy is a wild one….you must know…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“I already know everything…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“I didn’t interfere with YOU.”</p>
<p>Her mother remained silent for a long while, and gliding out of the bed, said coldly:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“You know, of course, that we are getting married.  I didn’t even want it, but that’s how things turned out…”</p>
<p>Rozshke sat up, eyes blazing, and Etel saw her full ample arms and taut, rosy breasts for the first time:</p>
<p class="dialogue"> “Why am I to blame if Leon wants me…he says he loves me and is ready for me….”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What are you talking about?!  You’re not even fifteen years old, yet…he might cause a great misfortune…don’t ruin my life…”</p>
<p>Rozshke clutched at her face and suddenly let out a childish, frightened cry.
Etel rushed towards her, dropping the dress she was to wear as she ran and, falling upon the girl, began to probe. The girl tore her mother’s hot and shivering hands from her body.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What do you want from me? Leave me alone…,” she cried.</p>
<p>The mother then held her uncomfortably close and spoke with a burning voice into her ear, almost choking Rozshke:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Tell me, tell me…what’s he done to you?”</p>
<p>Rozshke said nothing for a long time.  She no longer cried. The mother kept on repeating: “Tell me…tell me…when??” Over and over again. Exhausted from the strain, she began to lash out, delivering hard, dry slaps upon Rozshke’s head, face and shoulders.</p>
<p>
Rozshke barely felt any pain.  She covered her face and cried out with a new, piercing woman’s voice:   “You can….everyone does it….all the girls and the apprentices…”</p>
<p>Etel fell onto a stool… opening her eyes and mouth as if to cry out…but no sound emerged from her lips.  Suddenly old Golda appeared, silent upon the threshold:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
 “What are you doing with the girl? The day doesn’t stand still…when will you be ready?”</p>
<p>Etel looked at her mother with crazed eyes:  “Bobbe (grandma), enjoy your grandchild.” She suddenly burst into tears:  “My sweet mother-this girl,who knows what he has done…”</p>
<p>The old woman understood immediately:
 “Daughter, leave the room now.”
She came close to Rozshke: “I could see that this was not the kind of boy to go with…”
“Bobbe… don’t interfere …,” pleaded Rozshke.</p>
<p>But the old woman paid her no heed:  “Rayzele, Rozshke…tell your grandmother...I will understand you….don’t spoil this day.  Understand, your mother was a lonely widow for so long, and now, with God’s help…she will be married…do you want to ruin this?  Tell me; perhaps he did something bad…that young upstart….the mechanic’s son…”</p>
<p>Rozshke stretched out to her full length upon the bed. She let her grandmother approach. The old woman embraced her and bent down towards her. For the first time, Rozshke felt a warm glow of tenderness.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Rayzele, tell me …what did he do?  I see that you are somehow different…nu, so tell me...did he kiss you …caress you?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Yes,” was Rozshke’s answer.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And after that…where did it happen…tell me….did he bother you, molest you?…Such a cad, an urchin….and maybe all he did was kiss you? Did he lift up your dress? You can tell me, tokhter.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“So who should know?  My child, you must say something…you probably know what this can lead to…what would you like me to do? I can go to the mechanic... I can go to the boy’s father...”
“You don’t have to go, Bobbe…What do you want from me?. Nothing happened...leave me alone…”</p>
<p>
The grandmother sprang wildly away from her then, and shouted out to Etel:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“What do you want from her, crazy woman?” </p>
<p>Rozshke buried her head in the pillow, moaning softly: “Leon, Leon…”</p>

<hr>

<p>A wedding was held – a proper ‘proletarian’ wedding. Although they went to the Rabbi to arrange for the ceremony, they all made fun of the religious parts of the celebration. Wolf, the groom – the tailor’s apprentice - who was seven years younger than Etel, cared very little for the ritual ceremony. Everyone made lewd jokes about how a ‘widow is better’.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Wolf”, the young men shouted, “you’re in partnership with an old business.”</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Old Zelig felt young on these occasions.  He continued telling jokes, took a glass of whisky, and even forgot the reason for the simkha (joyful occasion).  He spouted endless clever sayings and riddles.  When he saw that the house was full of workers and young people, he began talking of his socialist past, telling long-winded stories about comradely meetings in the woods and camps with the Russian police. He followed this with a drunken rousing song - some kind of political oath.</p>
<p>Etel busied herself with the guests.  She was dressed in a black dress and looked like an older woman.  Only her eyes glistened with a guilty, yet promising, shine.</p>
<p>
The young ones knew of her behavior with Wolf, and chided her with jibes and jokes:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Etel, when will we lead you to your ‘confinement’?”</p>
<p>
They grabbed old Golda, her mother, and cried out:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Have you let your daughter in on the secret?”
The old woman spat out, good naturedly:  “Curses upon you all…silly children!”</p>
<p>The house became even fuller. A gramophone, borrowed from the mechanic, began to play, and some of the young women and men started to dance.  A youngster with a long nose and glasses was making merry by imitating pieces from the Yiddish theater, while a girl with a sickly, pallid face declaimed angry proletariat poetry. She ranted and raved, her hands flaying, as if wielding a hammer. Only late at night did Rozshke finally appear. She was not wearing the newly ironed dress her mother had prepared for her, and had actually disappeared sometime after noon. She did not want to help in the house, and had wished to avoid the wedding entirely.</p>
<p>No one in the house mentioned this, but the mother said to Wolf, several times:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“The girl is going crazy!...Who knows what she may do…she must be watched.”</p>
<p>And for the first time, Wolf noticed Rozshke as she entered, when the young men, drunk on whiskey and love, tried to tease and grab her. Only now did Wolf recall what Etel had said, and he fixed his gaze deeply upon Rozshke and the fifteen-year-old girl suddenly grew up in his eyes. He caught a glance at her full round legs moving under her short dress.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he thought: “She is now my daughter.” But he did not like the idea of being her father.</p> 
<p>He felt that this corner into which he had been forced might develop into a more promising situation.</p>
<p>Rozshke ran through the entire room until she came to the small alcove she shared with her mother. The room was now light and the bed pushed off into a corner. She sat there, on the bed, a stormy look on her face, her neck burning hot under her short hair.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her mother approached her: “Rozshke…why don’t you get dressed up?…It’s really not nice…say something to Wolf.”</p>
<p>She did not answer. At that moment, Wolf came over to her with a swagger, and dropped down towards Rozshke. She felt the sickly scent of his newly cut hair mixed with the smell of whiskey.  He placed his hand on Rozshke’s head, which she promptly removed.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Rozshke,” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
It was the first time that he had addressed her with any type of tenderness: </p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Rozshke…today we are no longer strangers…”</p>
<p>
The girl hid her head and did not answer. He waited a minute, and lightly placed his broad hand on her knees. The girl trembled. Etel came over and said:
“Leave her alone, Wolf…she is a wild girl…”</p>
<p>The girl jumped up and ran through the house until she came to the door of the dark front hall. There, in the gray light, she rested, panting, and trying to breathe. A few children and neighbors were standing around. A woman with a deep voice asked:</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Rozshke…why don’t you go in?…Don’t you want to dance at your mother’s wedding?”</p>
<p>The people gathered there began to laugh. Then Rozshke let herself out of the hall and went outside. There, on the steps, Leon was waiting for her, and wordlessly they both crept up to their attic hiding place.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Where will you live now?  Together with them?” the young man asked, holding her near. She fell into his arms: “I don’t know…..don’t ask me…”</p>
<p>
She got up and sat down on the old table. The music from the gramophone and the noise of the wedding hardly reached them here.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“What will become of me?” Rozshke asked, stroking Leon’s heavy curls.
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“I will run away with you!” he said, as she felt his cold lips and teeth pressing on her full mouth.
Suddenly they fell into each others’ arms and were carried away.</p>

<hr>

<p>Late that night, midst the noise and the whiskey and the hot-blooded girls and boys, Rozshke made her way silently back to her bed. The only sound she heard was Old Zelig giving a speech and singing his oath. She curled up and felt that somewhere her dress was torn, and that a stocking had been lost.  She felt frightened, lost to the whole world. She remembered the sweet pain of lying on the hard, rough carpenter’s table. She let herself swim out into the wide world outside. </p>
<p>All at once, she smelled the sharp odor of the whiskey Wolf had brought her. She swallowed down the whole glass all at once, eyes shut. At that moment, she again felt his hand, gliding over her naked skin; her dress was torn, her stocking lost.
She fell asleep with tightly closed lips and a devil-may-care attitude towards the whole world…the dark world, where people, like wild dogs, push and tear at one another, doing sweet, wordless things.</p>
