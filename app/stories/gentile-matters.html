<p>The hunters took up half a compartment on the train -  all older, heavy goyim with mighty moustaches: some were thin, with long, bony legs covered in stretched hose, wearing burnished leather boots; some were fat and broad, with ‘landowners’ hands, bearing signet rings.  They sat wearing their green hats adorned with feathers and their leather jackets, while strewn around them – across their thighs, on and under the seats of the carriage – lay their hunting rifles, engraved pouches with buckshot and ammunition.  From under the seats, one could see the open, glazed eyes of the large dead hares.</p>
<p>The other half of the compartment was filled with Jews, who came from the nearby towns with their packages, parcels, their baskets and bundles.</p>
<p>The hunters were smoking pipes and carrying on lively conversations.  They spoke of the hunt.  An open bottle of cognac stood at hand and each tale ended with an outburst of a bit of drunken laughter.  It was by now quite dark in the compartment, and the Jews, seeing the leather pouches and rifles, were silent. Some simply buried their worried beards into their shoulders and drowsed.  Others glanced sideways with sharp eyes, listening with contempt to the noisy stories.  The hunters spoke only of matters dealing with the hunt or guns; of forests, and of those who were sharpshooters, and those who were not. Often a hunter would stand up on shaky legs, grab a rifle and show the others how he had taken aim directly on a hare, and yet the animal had run off.  Each time a hunter raised a rifle the Jews would turn their heads and blink their eyes. One Jew even said quietly to his neighbor:
“Fellow Jews, we really should move to the next compartment…it’s not healthy for us to sit here…’
Especially loud was the tall, thin hunter wearing yellow boots, who drank the most cognac.  He described the story of his chase, his aim and shooting, how the blood flowed, and how his dog retrieved the prey.  He spoke mainly to the heavily whiskered gentleman whom he addressed as “Panie Doktazshe”. The listener was engrossed in the story and questioned each and every detail: where the rabbit stood, how he fell, on which side, what the forest looked like – was it beyond Lemberg or closer to Radom?  Then a second hunter, an older, graying blond whom the others called ”Panie Sendzsyoh”, stood up and began to tell a long tale about his friend, a prosecutor, who was in chase after a bird, but could not catch it.  Wherever he shot, he missed his mark until a second hunter appeared and, with a single shot, felled the bird.  At this point, he related, his friend returned home, locked himself in his study, took out his revolver, and shot himself. They all shook their heads vigorously, and once again began drinking cognac.</p>
<p>After this tale, the Jews looked at one another, tucked one sleeve into the other, and sighing softly, drifted off to sleep.  A young man with glasses, wearing a fedora, sat among the Jews and listened intently to the hunters’ stories.  A Jew with a yellowing beard whispered to him from the side: “Young man, why do you listen so closely to all these khokhmes (clever words)?  Better not to pay attention to such things.” </p>
<p>When the blondish hunter had finished his tragic story about his friend, a second man got up and began telling of the long night he had spent in a watery ditch, because he wanted to shoot a duck…to which the Pan Dokter responded:  “Yes, yes…so many different hardships…”</p>
<p>The train sped along.  The conductor entered the carriage, and turned on the lights.  The Jews sat quietly watching the hunters through half-closed eyes.  Now, when there was light, the tall hunter wearing yellow boots dragged the dead hare out from under the seat.  Its head hung low, as the hunter held it up for all to see.  Dark blood dripped from the dead animal.  The hunter shouted:</p>
<p>“People! For three days I slept in the woods, eating dry bread, traveling twelve hours - in addition to walking several more miles on foot – but it was all worthwhile!  I am bringing something home!  I shall not arrive with empty hands…Am I right, people?”</p>
<p>At that moment the train began to slow down.  The group of hunters suddenly awoke as one.  They took their packs, slung their rifles on their shoulders and within minutes had managed to vacate the carriage, leaving behind an empty bottle and blood stains from the hare.  Only then did the Jews begin to rouse themselves with deep groans and sighs.  They looked around and, seeing that the hunters were gone, said to one another:
“Tell me, uncle…what could such a hare cost?”
  “A hare? I don’t know…maybe a few zlotes…”
 “So, the goyim are really crazy!”</p>
<p>Then the young man with the glasses turned to them:
“You don’t understand, Jews…this is not about how much money a hare costs. This is all about ambition!”
“About what?” asked a Jew from the opposite bench.
“About ambition! About prestige!”
And from all sides, from every corner, a beard was thrust out, asking:
“About what?”</p>
<p>The young man kept shouting: “Ambition!  Pride!” 
 Until a Jew with a small ash-gray beard said:
“Enough, Yidden! What does this have to do with us?  Let us better put a Jewish word in our mouth!”</p>
<p>And all stood up to chant the prayers for Ma’ariv.(the daily evening prayer).     </p>
