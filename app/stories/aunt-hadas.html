<p>AUNT HADAS*
DI MUME HADAS</p>

<p>E.  Kaganovski</p>


<p>All that remained of my childhood memories mingled with the cloudy, meager light shining from the simple, green kerosene lamp that stood on a long metal pedestal. The lamp stood in the middle of the table, gently spreading a quiet, sparse green light that blended with the blackness of the surrounding corners.</p>

<p>The evenings were a long frightening passage from night to day, starting out a bit grayish in the dark corners that slowly gripped my mind, developing into a vast and threatening wilderness peopled by angry fearsome trees. The few steps from my room to the kitchen and to the last dark, windowless alcove danced me through a thousand fearsome images. I sat on a low stool, hugging my knees in the warm, green ring of lamplight, and was beset by fears that rose up continually from the dark alcove. A long procession of dead uncles, aunts and grandmothers peered out at me from there. Baba Breindel with her red cheeks, white wimple and her small pointy shoulders hid there.  From there, she wandered around, saving the poor sick children of the family.
But the worst was Uncle Wolf…Uncle Wolf was an angry man, with a rough, wiry beard and bushy eyebrows.  He wandered around choking people. Feared by everyone, all avoided him.</p>
<p>My eyes burned with fear. As soon as daylight broke and the dark shadows blended into the walls, my restlessness abated.</p>
<p>Caring for the lamp was an exciting time – gently wiping the long, fluted glass, preparing the wick, and polishing the burner.  I felt that it was only the mighty strength of the lamp that saved us, again and again, from the terrible darkness.
I would look out the window at the darkened courtyard, where the flames of other lamps shone brightly. I saw the watchman carry the small, smoking lamps to light the dark stairwells.   My heart swelled to bursting with great pity for the whole world, for my dead little brothers who were taken midst the black smoke into the long, dark boxes on a pallet.  I thought of them stumbling around endlessly in the gloom, far from our green lamp and our mother’s warm bosom.</p>
<p>Mother begrudged lighting the lamp early. I would ask, standing close to her:</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Mame, when will you finally light the lamp?”</p>
<p>
Mother however, did not hurry, and I feared for her. I imagined that she ignored the shadows that lurked about us.</p>
<p>On such evenings, mainly during autumn or winter, when the windows clattered with an angry cold bluster, it seemed as if the entire world was remote and far away; the short burst of day quickly retreated into the long, dark night.
On such evenings, my childish heart would beat rapidly with fear that took my breath away.  During those long winter nights, I would fall asleep, dream and wake again suddenly, often shrieking in panic.
                                                        
<p>Mother was sorting laundry- old, forgotten clothes. With her drooped head, she sorted….sorted and sang. All of her songs were sad and lonely.
One was a song about a dead cantor, another a ‘morality’ song about a murderer who washes his bloody hands in a stream in the woods, but the water shuns his bloody stains.</p>
<p>A strong, gray hand pressed down upon my heart: ‘Why have I come into this terrible world, surrounded by the deep, dark night?  Who brought me here?’ A feeling of jealousy towards my dead brothers welled up in me…they, who lay in the field, the cemetery.  A great sadness engulfed me, an angry fear gnawing – like a worm - at my heart.  With tears that no one understood, I would fall asleep nightly pressed into my mother’s warmth.  </p>
<p>Beneath the meager light of the green lamp and the hovering shadows from all corners of the house, lay the memories of my childhood’s long evenings.
Forced to go to bed early in the evening, I would lie in bed with tightly-closed eyes.  As I lay there, my watchful restless brain picked up every word of the discussion taking place among the adults, grouped around the lit-up table.
All they said informed me of an outside world, which I could only see through the window.  I never slept for long, and my mind was sharp and alert; my ear did not miss the tiniest murmur.  Before my sleeping eyes, a remarkable procession of events would unfold.</p>
<p>I was apparently quite ill during those far-off clouded days.  I would often feel my mother’s warm hand pressed gently to my head.  And I well remember the cold, foreign touch of doctors and medics, or a strange adult face, and the sudden, wooden tap of a small hammer on my bare back.  My hand would lean on the hard knee of a doctor, and I imagined that the knees did everything to make me feel worse, because these doctors would always touch me in the places that hurt the most.  It seemed to me that their pockets were full of painful instruments, and I wondered why my mother sent for them.
I especially remembered the “bad” doctor who laid his hard, scratchy head and red hands, stinking of antiseptic, upon me.  He shouted loudly and his words were piercing.  After he left, I would lie still and think, overcome by fatigue, believing and almost hoping that everyone else had gone; that I was the only one left in the entire world.</p>
<p>Only in the evening, when the fearsome darkness appeared once again beyond the windows, did the real world return to me.  Mother had prepared the lamp once again, rubbing the long tubular glass until it squeaked with cleanliness.  The flame caught hold and the strange shadows again rose up along the walls.  Slowly, the flame settled into a circle round the table.  Here, mother sat with her sewing and her knitting.  I knew just by looking at the shirts, which were father’s, the ones with many holes and patches.  One shirt was edged with an embroidered neckline of blue and red.  This was the “Malorosyske” shirt, brought from somewhere near Kiev. 
I looked at the pale halo of the lamp, and at my mother’s lowered eyes.<br>I knew each and every stain and smear on the blue wall next to my bed:  two half-circles, a long line, and a dot.  The dot looked like a fly; next to it was a damp patch.  Mother told me to go to sleep. She explained that the winter would soon be over, summer would come, and father would earn some money….he would bring…would bring.<br>She did not say that we were poor, but I knew this.  She would always say to my father: “People live! People have homes!”, and I imagined that all these people who “lived” somehow didn’t allow father to ‘bring’.  That’s how I would fall asleep…and mother would sing the sad song about the “murderer”.  But I always woke up the minute father came in. I woke up.  My gaze was immediately drawn to my father’s young, strong shoulders; his head, covered with thick dark hair, partly visible by the light of the lamp.</p>
<p>Mother’s brother, Yossl, sat at her side.  He was tall with a pale, handsome face.  He had been with us for a long time.  He came from mother’s town and brought large, sweet-smelling cookies.  Then there was father’s friend, Shakhne, the good Shakhne who always had something special for me in his pockets. He had a round, stooped back and one arm was shorter than the other.  With the very large hand on the shorter arm, he would gently stroke me and casually throw a few playthings, smelling of fresh wood or shiny metal, onto my bed.
That night, house was full of the shadows of real people, and my heart was full of joy.  Everyone was here – my father, Yossl and Shakhne.  I covered my eyes and felt my father’s hand touch my head several times.  I breathed in the damp, cold smell of the street coming from his clothes, and I waited.
I waited to hear something about Aunt Hadas, about this aunt whom I had seen only once, as in a dream.  I saw her blond, curly hair and the green dress from which her soft white arms emerged.  I imagined her as a large and beautiful doll, whose smile lit up the house.    </p>
<p>But after that one time, I never saw her again.  I heard that she had somehow moved away, and strangely all my senses seemed to follow her.  She went to see a certain Khayim, after which she was to return.  When they spoke of Aunt Hadas, they also spoke of this Khayim, and this Khayim loomed large and dark in my mind.  I was afraid of him.  Somehow he had done something to my lovely Aunt Hadas. 
 My mother pulled at her hair in frustration, as father began to tell of Khayim’s “making her life miserable.”
Father said: “Poor, dear Hadas”.  My heart began to beat wildly and a silent sobbing overcame me.  I turned towards the wall, and from the rods and knobs of my bed emerged the huge, black and fearsome Khayim.  He silently approached the golden Hadas.  I quietly stretched out my hand and slapped the wall, wanting to somehow to hurt the awful Khayim.
*</p>
<p>They sat around the table, whispering:
“…with Hadas…things are very bad…” 
By the light of the table, the dark, ominous words tumbled down, like angry birds:
“..such a golden Hadas…”
“..and where is he, this Khayim?…”
“He’s here…”
“He sucked out her life’s blood.”
“…and Hadas…?”
“You should see her….you wouldn’t recognize her.”</p>
<p>Tears welled up in my throat and a blinding flash seared my eyes.  The terrible Khayim rose up menacingly in my mind, like the dark night beyond the windows, and I suddenly heard my mother saying, as she ate:  “But Hadas loves him…this Khayim…”
A wild, broken cry escaped from my chest, and I began to tremble.
They all stood around me, feeling my forehead.</p>
<p>Mother said:  “The child is very sick…he burns like fire…”
I was not sick.  A hot, burning pain for Aunt Hadas pressed down upon me, for her shame, and a glaring hatred towards this awful Khayim choked me.
Once again the “bad” doctor came.  He began to shout, and again his scratchy head lay  upon my chest.  But I waited only for the evening, when I would learn more.   Mother once again spoke angrily about Hadas: “…she gave ‘him’ all she had…. Hadas cried… Khayim arrived drunk…Khayim took the money… Hadas’s last penny….hard-earned labor…her blood.”
Mother cried into the blue shirt: “Poor, unfortunate Hadas”.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I felt hot.  I imagined a small barking dog , crawling up onto my bed….a tiny dog that could barely be seen…but the dog soon grew larger, terribly big, monstrous - as big as the house!  I was frightened and began gasping for breath: “I am choking!”  I cried out with a great shriek...I no longer wanted to pretend I was sleeping.  I began sobbing…I am sick…soon I will die.  Just like Brukhel, the neighbor’s youngster who died.  Mother clasped me to her breast….her eyes looked at me strangely, wide with worry:
“My child….my child…”
Mother spit over my head, and drew me even further into herself, and I murmured:  “Hadas, Hadas…”</p>
<p>There is a tumult all around me…the noise of many voices, as if it were a holiday.  People are here, in the house, my father as well, even though it is still daylight.  A small stream of light slowly spirals in through the window, dancing around the chairs near my bed.  Something is happening.  On the bed is a new toy made out of red wood, and a wire clasp.  Mother is leaning over me, her cool hair brushes my face and she says:<br>“Aunt Hadas has come to see you…”
My eyes are closed and my fingers wander, finally meeting smooth silk; a warm smell of fragrant skin, like a far-away memory of wedding perfume.</p>
<p>I feel Aunt Hadas’s hands in mine.  Through half-closed eyes, I see her.  A dry chill from her faded cheek touches mine, and a deep shudder goes through me.
I don’t want to let her go.  Suddenly, feeling strong and healthy, I press her to me, shamefully:
“Aunt Hadas,” slips from my mouth, and I hear her voice, a generous, light blond voice:  “Do you love me?”<br>“Love,” I murmur.
“Khayim, come to the child.”
My eyes fly open; near my bed, on a stool, sits a strange, short Jew with a heavy, red face.  Large teeth show from behind his moustache.
He stretches out a small, squarish hand to me.
“No, I don’t want to,” I protest, and clasp Aunt Hadas’s head, press it to me and cry: “I don’t want to…I don’t want to…no, no…”  And I feel another current of strength run through my hands and legs….
*</p>
<p>A few bleak drops of rain slid down the window panes, as though the glass was covered in sweat.  The late autumn afternoon began to fill the house with ominous darkness.  It was cold, even though the flames from the stove glowed brightly.</p>
<p>Uncle came in and gave a cold tap to the mezuzah (prayer scroll) hanging in the doorway.  His gray beard held a sad silence.  This was my Uncle Veve, the jolly uncle that would always joke with us, pulling this one’s ear or tickling that one’s belly.  Two other aunts also arrived, Aunt Rickl and Aunt Khayke.  They were dressed in long, sleeveless overcoats, like two black velvet wingless birds.  They hurried into the far room, leaving behind them the acrid smell of mothballs.  This time, they had brought nothing; they had come empty-handed.  Even my uncle did not bother to leave his elegant bone-topped cane in the hall, but rushed straight into the far room.  My father and mother were also there.  Mother left the door ajar, but her head peered out often.  Her face held a look of hidden anxiety and she kept signaling us children to be quiet.</p>
<p>The lamp had not been lit.  It stood aloof , cold and strange ,on the table with the green tablecloth.  By now it was really dark; the evening lurched through the windows like an angry dog.  We youngsters gathered in the darkest corner near the stove, where the black, shiny oilcloth of the couch reflected the dancing flames.  In hushed tones, we told childish stories of dark stairways always leading to cellars or attics, and of old beggars who stole children from their beds.</p>
<p>Evenings in the darkened house conjured up fears, and a need to keep close to one another.  Only little Sara’le knew something.  Her large watchful eyes were fixed on the closed door to the far room, from whence one could hear a low, controlled rumbling of voices.</p>
<p>Sara’le held up a finger, her eyes opened wide with a fixed look, and she spoke, in a halting, frightening voice:  “She has converted….”
Frightened by her own words, she and the other children jumped - as if to run away from this harsh truth.
“Sha, sha, quiet…Aunt Hadas….”</p>
<p>The long winter evening seemed to go on forever.  The house was neglected. No one cooked and the kitchen was cold.  Father was nowhere to be seen for a long time, and all through the night, groans and sighs were heard from the beds.  Mother’s soft, wet eyes looked as if she were crying without tears.
The far room, where the children were not allowed to enter, was full of people during the day.  For dinner, mother served some cold meat and wurst (sausage), which reminded us of erev Pesakh – the night before Passover, when all khametz (leavened bread), was burned.  But this was not a quiet, restrained commotion that echoed in the corners.  Only the eleven-year-old Sara’le was able to catch any hint of what went on behind the closed door.  Holding a finger to her lips, she managed to say in hushed tones:  “Aunt Hadas…”</p>
<p>Aunt Hadas, the lovely Hadas with her warm, scented hands had disappeared.  She had vanished, together with the warm summer day, and we no longer saw her.  Mother and father said that she had simply gone away.  But in the same breath they sighed and added mumbled words.  I asked nothing.
In the dark hours of the night, when the children were sent to sleep, she appeared to me on the shadowy, yellow wall next to my bed.  Then, everything was bright, and the intoxicating smell of her smooth fragrant hands would rise up out of the cold, dark night.</p>
<p>I see her stretch up, on her long, strong legs, bathed in multi-colored rays of light.<br> I feel the caress of her sweet perfumed hair, and hold my breath.   I covered my head with the blanket.  </p>
<p> Then she appeared as I had last seen her, when she was with us at the summer house, on that indescribably lovely, clear day. 
She takes me by the hand and leads me into the woods, where a silvery haze engulfs the heat of the day.  There in the woods, near the small lake, she sits down.  Her long legs emerge gracefully from the folds of her light summer dress. She takes off her stockings, and her golden laughing eyes gaze upon me with sweet concern: “You are only a young boy,” she says, and smiles.
And with her sweet, sun-kissed lips, she draws my face near.  I close my eyes.
The silvery haze thickens; I imagine music in the air…wafting over us from somewhere.  </p>
<p>Aunt Hadas, larger than life, stands near the lake.  She is awesome, tall, and naked.  Her skin seems to glow, to burn, as if in a well of light.
My heart begins to beat wildly.  I want to stay. I want to leave. But there is no way out.
In the midst of all this, I find that I am angry with Aunt Hadas.  I throw myself down and bury my head in the cool grass.  In the seductive darkness, I once again see my naked Aunt Hadas.  Her arms and legs are large, and her whiteness quickly becomes a rosy flame.  Something disturbs me deeply, and I want to run away, to escape somehow, but all at once a howling cry carries me away.  I awaken to a sudden, piercing downpour of rain.  Aunt Hadas is half-dressed, but her bare feet quickly spring into motion.  The wind blows her hair in all directions, and she laughs as I run effortlessly beside her.  </p>
<pre><code>    *
</code></pre><p>That is the last time I see my Aunt Hadas.  Now, in the darkened corner of the house, when Sara’le  uttered those strange angry words, I suddenly see her once again.  The same wind blows, but this time it is laden with fear and worry.  I imagine her flying around in a dark, horrid world, angry winds blowing her about.  I smell the disturbing antiseptic odor of the hospital and illness, and once more I see the serious Sisters dressed in black carrying her away.  And the word “shmad”( conversion), stands before us all in fearsome, black letters. </p>
<p>I went quietly over to Sara’le and whispered:  “Sare’le, how does one convert?”
Sara’le raised her dark, shining eyes and answered:  “With a crucifix- you take a crucifix….”
She began to tell us children, as in a dream:  “They carried her away…she swore an oath… The bells rang in the church…,” and she suddenly burst into tears.
She started to snivel and sob in spasms, like a woman.
I also felt a deep cry welling up in me.
At this point Mother came in and pulled Sara’le to her breast.
“What’s wrong with the child?  We must light the lamp!”</p>
<p>I could no longer remain quiet and, pressing my head into mother’s palm, 
I shouted:  “Sara’le …..Sara’le  says that Aunt Hadas has converted.”
My mother placed a hand quickly over my mouth, and pressed me to her, 
so that I could no longer speak.
“Sha, sha, hush, hush, what kind of talk is this?”  And she herself began to weep bitterly.</p>
<p>“Children, children, what are you saying?  Aunt Hadas will come soon.
She was not well…she was not.  Today she will come.  She will soon come.” </p>
<p>There was a great commotion at the door.  Mother pushed us aside and ran forward.  Cousin Peskhl, recently released from the army, appeared with mother on the other side, and between them, supported under the arms like a fainting, pale apparition, swaying dangerously on stumbling feet, was Aunt Hadas.  Her hands hung limply from her shoulders, and her eyes were half closed.</p>
<p>All was quiet.  The door was closed and mother began to light the lamp on a side table, like when my grandmother died.  Soon, my two aunts in their great sleeveless cloaks emerged, as though pushed out, from the far room.
Uncle Veve could be heard shouting at them, with a wailing “Yom Kippur”
synagogue voice.</p>
<p>The evening seemed endless, with the lamp burning off in the corner, deep shadows forming on the walls.  I lay in bed with a beating heart.  Strange dreams invaded my sleep – I saw black people milling about the threatening gate of the Christian church.  Suddenly I awoke, heart beating wildly.  I did not know whether it was night or day.</p>
<p>I slipped out of bed quietly and, shivering from both cold and fear, I stole into the far room.  Everything had been moved – the table, the benches, all pushed aside – and on the black, carved table stood a silver candelabra shedding white light.  In contrast, a bluish, cold light filtered in through the window.  And here, lying on the sofa, deep among the piled-up bedclothes, lay Aunt Hadas.  Her eyes were closed and fluttered gently in sleep; one hand, strangely white, had strayed from under the covers.</p>
<p>I leaned over in fright, listened for her breathing, and took in her scent.
She smelled as always, of the gentle fragrance of flowers, but no, it seemed there was something else - a sharp, acrid smell as well.  Her lips were pale, and pursed, as though beckoning.  I was frightened, and a powerful sense of pity pushed me to the tips of my toes, my bare feet arching upwards.  Lost in dark confusion, I pressed my lips to her mouth. Then I felt her hand, ever-so-gently embracing my head.  Her lips were dry and her tears, when they finally fell, burned my skin to the bone.</p>
