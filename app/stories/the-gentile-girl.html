<p>It first began with a hasty word and a wink.  The young people gathered more closely together, and grasped each bit of news, as one would relish a good cigarette that someone had brought.
“A shikse.”
“A real shikse?”
“A real one.”  </p>
<p>Among the circle of friends, who gathered almost every evening in the café around the same table, there spread a current of curiosity.  One demanded of another:  “So where is this shikse…when will we finally see her?”</p>
<p>The girls and women round the circle were quick to voice their attitude;
Fraulein Ola, the prettiest of the group, reasoned with some regret:</p>
<p>“So what if she is a shikse? What is a shikse….a different person?
 Herein lies the weakness of Jewish men…. for a non-Jewish woman they would go through fire!  I have been hearing about a shikse for several days and simply don’t understand….what kind of ‘sensation’ is this?  Sounds
to me like a very provincial demeaning expression.”</p>
<p>Whereupon  there  continued a long discussion about Jewish and non-Jewish women regarding beauty and honesty.  The men agreed that the non-Jewish woman is simpler, more practical and more emotional.  This caused a quarrel between the young Leiberman couple, and she angrily moved away from him:  “Go, so take yourself off to the shikse.” </p>
<p>Leon, the youngest of the group, considered by everyone a ‘Don Juan’, preened his shiny black forelocks and complained:
“What is the difference? I have many friends who are shikses….so what?”
He even began to recall how a Christian girl – of the upper class - fell in love with him.  They interrupted him with ridicule asking:
“A duchess?”
“A countess?”
“Perhaps a minister’s daughter?”</p>
<p>Leon did not continue the discussion. </p>
<p>All were present in the café the next evening.  No one was going to forego this occasion.  The table was richly set because today the shikse would appear. Edward was to bring her there.  He was a young man of thirty plus years, a wholesale supplier.  He was also one of those who did not care for Jewish women.  He had many complaints about Jews in general.  He worked among Christians and prided himself on their attitude towards him, but everyone was aware that he himself came from a religious Jewish family.</p>
<p>The whole group had been friends since their school days, getting together in  their families’ homes where they met throughout the years.  Together they celebrated birthdays, family occasions, went to the theater and concerts.  But for the last few days, Edward was somehow missing.  The shikse must have been the reason.</p>
<p>The discussion began to warm up.  The women asked bitterly:
“Nu, what’s the problem? Does one have to hide if you meet a shikse?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he’s afraid that she’ll be ‘grabbed’ away by someone else?”
The men responded jokingly : “Let’s first see if she’s worth ‘grabbing’.”</p>
<p>“ If one searches, he shall find.” they said of Edward.  And each new guest that approached the table was asked:  “Have you seen Edward yet, with the shikse?”</p>
<p>All at once Edward appeared.  He entered the café and came to the table, wiping his eyeglasses.  All heads were craned towards him, and there appeared - next to him - a small well formed girl, with  rosy Polish facial features, a snub nose, blue eyes and blond hair.</p>
<p>Edward greeted them all from afar, then came closer to the table.  He led the shikse before him, and the closer she got, the group’s glances became more direct and curious.  Finally, all the men stood and the introductions began.</p>
<p>A special glow shone over Edward’s face.  His eyes almost spoke :
“Nu…see …what do you say?”</p>
<p>Yes, this was a lovely shiksl (a young gentile girl).   She had a sweet mouth and soft deep-red lips .  A special gentleness shone from her eyes, like the blue of corn flowers.</p>
<p>She joyfully greeted both the men and women, and then sat down.  At first, all was quiet as everyone looked her over, until Edward simply asked:
“Well, how do you like the shikse?”</p>
<p>She responded laughing childishly, and suddenly everything became lighter and easier.  And everyone immediately liked her.  The uncomfortable stiffness was gone because the shiksl  spoke pleasantly and willingly about her non-Jewishness, and added that many of her friends were Jews.</p>
<p>A feeling of happiness and comfort was felt round the table.  Every one spoke to her in the way a fine guest would be welcomed.  She responded with a gentle simplicity.   Moreover, in no time at all she was at ease and related to all in a familiar way, so that not a thread of a ‘different’ world was marked.  She spoke of her two brothers, and all were surprised that they were not officers, or did not have special non-Jewish trades.
The shiksl herself was called Yadzshe , and she asked to be called by that name.</p>
<p>The evening in the café lasted for a long time, and in leaving, each one sought out Edward to quietly whisper:  “An impressive shiksl…”
Edward glowed.   “Where did you find her?” asked another.</p>
<p>One of the women started to say: “It seems to me that she is not a Jew lover, but one never knows.”</p>
<p>Everyone reproached her: “Stop all this nonsense !  A golden shiksl…one does not feel a trace of anti-semitism from her.”</p>
<p>“Children -  enough!  Edward is madly in love with her.”
“His eyes light up.”
“It will really be great if he actually falls in love with her.”
“A fine story!”
The women were all wrought up:  “From things like this the greatest tragedies are born.”</p>
<p>“Why? Among cultured people ….”
“Cultured …’shmultured’, a lost cause, nothing good will come of this.”</p>
<p>All the way home after Edward left, the discussion raged.  The men held that these were old fashioned prejudices, and Edward was hero of the day!</p>
<pre><code>                                          *
</code></pre><p>From that day on the shiksl came with Edward every evening to the café.  She seldom missed an evening.  She was even invited a few times by women of the circle, where special care was taken to entertain her.  Those evenings lasted until late at night.  Everyone liked Yadzshe .  She was so 
amiable and ‘at home’ with everyone – they were delighted with her.</p>
<p>When Edward and the others wanted to accompany her home at night, they learned that she lived closer than they had imagined.  It was somewhere along a strange white street that smelled of cabbage, whose window sills were adorned with pots of flowers, and where one felt a fear of dogs.  At the end, they found that she lived in one of the Jewish streets, but she asked to  be left a few gates before her house.   Edward explained that his was more comfortable for her.</p>
<p>Going home, the men did not stop talking about the shiksl Yadzshe.
After that evening, it was not just Edward’s private mission to bring the shikse.  She began coming on her own.  The young people felt so free and friendly in her presence, and she was often invited to go out to a movie, or the theater, to which she simply and happily agreed.</p>
<p>One could arrange an evening with her at the end of her work day.  She would come on these ‘dates’ with pleasure, so that even the wives had no cause to gossip.  Edward, it seemed, became a bit more careful.  The fact that he was no longer the sole ‘guardian’ of the shiksl, bothered him, and he lightly chastised her.</p>
<p>The shiksll felt so comfortable and friendly with the young people, that she became part of the group,  accepted as an integral part of the circle.  She knew about everyone’s affairs and was especially happy when they would turn to her in Yiddish:
“Vos makhstu, shikse?”  (How are you, shikse?)</p>
<p>Yadzshe laughed.  They taught her Yiddish idioms, and sayings which she would repeat comically.  Once she even said ‘levoneh’ (moon) on her own, delighting everyone.  She said that her friendship with Jews from childhood, had allowed her to understand almost everything that was spoken in Yiddish.</p>
<pre><code>                                               *
</code></pre><p>This special evening was an occasion, celebrating Leiberman’s wife’s birthday, and naturally the shikse was also invited.  She arrived wearing a new dress and looked exceptionally lovely.  Her unusual beauty, especially the blue eyes and the blond hair, stood out with  unique radiance.  She was warmly greeted, and in the toast, which was given by the humorous Adash, he specifically referred to her as “our shikse” – as all applauded ‘bravo!</p>
<p>On this special evening, the Leibermans had invited new guests, distant relatives, and other friends.  Some came especially to take a look at the shikse.  An older woman, a childhood friend, stood in the front hall before entering.  No sooner had she kissed Madam Leiberman when she asked:
“So, is the shikse here?”
“Of course,” came the answer.
“I must get to see her.”</p>
<p>The shikse was in a room further off, surrounded by young people who were engaged in lively conversation.  The shikse was holding forth about her good feelings towards Jews; that she felt no difference.  On the contrary.  she maintained that she felt even freer and more comfortable among Jews.
They looked at her with delight.  And the ‘Don Juan’ Leon, who had drunk several glasses, kissed her hand and said pompously:</p>
<p>“I drink to all beautiful women, regardless of religion or nationality.”
Everyone applauded .</p>
<p>Madam Leiberman entered the room with her old friend.  Naturally she wanted her to see the shikse, which was rather difficult because she was encircled by people.</p>
<p>“And this is our shikse! “ she said to her friend.  “Come and meet her.”</p>
<p>The friend opened her eyes wide, and covered her mouth quickly, as though she were coughing.  No one could tell whether she was coughing or laughing.  Suddenly they all heard her shrill voice:</p>
<p>“Since when have you become a shikse, Yadzshe?”</p>
<pre><code>                                    *
</code></pre><p>It became strangely quiet and tense in the room.  In all corners words were whispered and exchanged.  The details flew like lightening from corner to corner: that her father is a khosid  (pious Jew),…that they own a store selling kosher canvas, linen and tailors’ goods.  This friend, who lived in the same courtyard with the family for years, tells of her father who sits in the Succah singing zmires – rabbinical tunes.</p>
<p>No one came forward to admonish her, but all were angry.  Not as angry as regretful.  The accusations were made to Edward, and mostly by the men….warnings of an unclear betrayal…of a deceived illusion:</p>
<p>A Jewish sense of equality and love between strangers, between Jews and Gentiles, remained an illusion.</p>
