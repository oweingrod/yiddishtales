<p>Old Mauritz tried once again to shift his swollen aged feet and get down from the bed.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Two barrels”, he said to himself, “two barrels I have, not feet.”</p>

<p>He touched the rough stubble of his face.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Sima!” he cried out, “hand me the mirror”.</p>

<p>From the dark, steamy kitchen out stepped a small, round woman, wisps of gray hair drooping over a red flushed face, wet hands hanging at her sides. She scrutinized him carefully for several long moments and muttered:</p>

<p class="dialogue">“So…you have to see yourself?”</p>

<p>She took a longish, rectangular mirror from off the bureau, and handed it to him. </p>

<p class="dialogue">“Let’s see how the dress-coat looks, if it fits,” said old Mauritz, with a clownish grin.</p>

<p>He looked at his face in the mirror, a pale sallow vision, rough hair – like rusty wire – covered his yellowed, bloated reflection.</p>

<p>The mirror was left dangling in his limp, pallid hand, and with pursed lips, as if to make a feeble attempt at a whistle, his head sank, silently. </p>

<p>His clear, wide-open eyes were fixed on the dark floor, as if beholding an exciting vision.</p>

<p>He sat like this for a long time. Sima, his old plump wife, had walked past him several times, moist hands heavy at her sides. She was afraid to interrupt his deep and distant reverie.</p>

<p>Finally, she grazed his shoulder and said:</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Mauritz, why are you sitting like this? Perhaps…lie down”.</p>

<p>Mauritz woke up. Only now did he begin to understand. </p>

<p>All at once, in every corner of his own sick skin, everywhere, he found ruin and weakness. In those few minutes, he was on almost all the paths that his feet had trodden. People, places, all parts were visible to him; pieces of his life began to flow one into the other, like a moving screen, as though they wanted to speak and dance a wildly colorful dance of revenge.</p>

<p>And now, when Mauritz again looked around at the tired old house, it became clear to him that he would never be able to escape. Now he saw with great clarity the old yellowed chest of drawers, the crooked table, the lamp hanging from the broken hook. All this was familiar and secure, as if both protecting and encumbering him forever. For the first time in his entire life, Mauritz was engulfed in a sense of mystical foreboding.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Death. Death” These black words seemed to peck at his thoughts like sharp-beaked birds of darkness.</p>

<p>He felt his strength leaving him, the gray light from the window was fading and, like a heavy lump of clay, he fell back into bed again.</p>

<p>Eyes shut tight, he sensed his wife Sima standing forlornly above him. She tried to wake him, ask him something, but Mauritz refused to offer any sign of life. He imagined himself to be dead.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Let it come already!” he uttered, as if to some shadowy Force that hovered over him – “Let him come, Death!”</p>

<p>At the same time, a measure of warmth filled his body. Around his heart, he felt a strange constricting pressure, as a hot, foggy mist took hold of his head. Something seemed to grab him then, and carry him away.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he smelled the vinegary odor of beer, onions and raw meat from the old restaurant where he had worked for half his life. He saw the green, shabby wall of the guest room, the pictures of Samson the Hero, who had fought the Philistines – a squat, naked Jew with broad shoulders and a short beard - and here is the blue gas ring ...and there on the black floor, a musty dampness rising from the sprinkled yellow sand – and in come the guests – large, ruddy-faced people in suits with hats pushed back on their heads….and here comes the angry landowner, the crazy gentile with the pointed whiskers, and from all sides cries are heard: </p>

<p class="dialogue">“Mauritz, waiter Mauritz!”</p>

<p>Old Mauritz was the best waiter. His feet never rested. For thirty-five years he had traversed the moist, sand-covered floors of the restaurant. </p>

<p>Now he saw everything with precise clarity – now, when the thought of death filled his mind with complete and deafening darkness – now he recalled pieces of his long-forgotten life.</p>

<p>Here, the glistening kitchen, the bins and pots and sizzling kettles, cooks running to and fro, women and girls with wet, red hands and rough, warm skin…. the red flames of the kitchen glowing on their faces, and Mauritz, drawn to the warmth, the blood, the heat. He shouts out orders and teases the cooks….one in particular – Salke – a tall, weepy orphan, whom he remembers most of all. Whenever she set eyes upon him in the kitchen, things would fall from her hands. But Mauritz did not make any advances…she came to him, and gave him everything…she loved him…he remembers her large, gray faithful eyes, and her quiet ways. </p>

<p>Why is she no longer here? He doesn’t know, he was young…and when they came to tell him that she had poisoned herself, he had grabbed his overcoat, and immediately turned to leave…but at that moment, a large group of rich butchers had come in, demanding that Mauritz serve them. So Mauritz did not go to the funeral.</p>

<p>Later, there were others. On Saturdays, when Mauritz would dress up in his new clothes and his highly-polished shoes and go to the dance-class, he had never lacked for partners.</p>

<hr>

<p class="dialogue">“Mauritz!” Someone shouts in a drunken, rasping voice. It is the angry landowner, the turbid odor of beer emanating from his mouth.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Mauritz, you had best serve me as I deserve ….if not….”</p>

<p>And a drunken gentile, a knife wielder, with a head full of bristling blond spikes, eyes him warily.</p>

<p>But Mauritz is a good waiter. He attends to all with a smile, always ready to serve.</p>

<p>Then the small, plump Sima, a screeching young girl…the wedding in Prague, at her aunt’s home, where the better half of Prague was in attendance, as well as many good friends from the “Iron Gates” neighborhood. Sima had a small income and was hoping to set up her own business.</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered when he had first experienced this choking constriction in his heart, the cold sweats and terrible confusion…He had fallen down while holding a tray with three glasses of beer. At that moment he had felt as though a hand had cut off a part of his life and thrown it away, far away into some obscure and unknown void. </p>

<p>From then on, neither the warm, cozy kitchens nor the reassuring cooks could lift his spirits. Mauritz could simply not forget the grief of impending death, which seemed to have taken hold of him with a choking grasp. His legs seemed to buckle under him, and when the ruddy, drunken noisy guests would cry out for him, he remained still, in the midst of it all, a tray in his shaking hands, the light from the flaming lamps of the large room wheeling crazily before his eyes.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, the glowing fumes now engulfed him with fear; and so, with cloth napkin draped over his sleeve, he would often run out the back door into the yard in order to catch his breath, his chest heaving in the damp corner near the garbage cans, where the cats slithered about.</p>

<p>And so began a chain of empty days and darker nights. Sima suddenly became old and angry. She would call him nothing but “<em>shreklakh</em>” (horrible). She sought revenge for all her wasted, middle-age years, when she was simply a maid - for the broken dreams she had of owning her own business, for the hopeful and promising bride-and-groom days, when they talked about her business at the “Iron Gates” area, where market folk would come to eat at their place. The small amount of money they had both saved was squandered on doctors and medicines. Every free hour was spent in the waiting rooms of doctors and clinics. After each doctor’s visit, Mauritz thought he was better, and struggled to maintain the familiar and carefree life of a waiter.</p>

<p>He secretly dreamt of a new love, perhaps a waitress or a merry widow. He looked in the mirror, twirled his moustache, and took pains to add a bit of color to his pale watery face. A restless wave of old pleasure and joy caused his heart to skip a beat. At those times, he worked as he did in the old days, running from table to table like a dancer. He would crack jokes and, in the kitchen, his loud shouts for orders would ring out to the cooks. </p>

<p>Then he would always think of Salke, the poor orphan who had vanished from the world. Maybe she had really poisoned herself because of him? He would then become melancholy, overcome by a strange desire to rush out into the gloomy world and search for her. He believed her soul was somewhere, out there….and his heart was pierced by a deep pain, like a sick bird. Then, a great heaviness would flood his head once more, and he would lose the lightness of his ways. </p>

<p class="dialogue">“Mauritz, this can’t be happening”, he murmured to himself, bowing his head low under the heavy burden of his fate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Between day and night lie the gray hours, when good old friends come: waiters, hairdressers, and musicians, who knew each other from the old Warsaw years, from long work days together in restaurants, for weddings or <em>brisn’</em> (circumcisions). With the others comes “Avishel the Actor” an old <em>badkhn</em> (wedding jester) from the “Iron Gates”. Here, in this lonely house, they all get together – the ‘old guard’– as they refer to themselves. </p>

<p>They spread out, sitting wherever they can – on the old couch, on the trunk, on the straw chair that Sima brought from her years as a waitress. There they sit with sunken heads, lips clenched like monkeys, and then begins the familiar talk about the years gone by. How old is each one? Witty sayings abound, about their graying hair which barely covers their bony skulls. And Avishel, the old <em>badkhn</em>, once more recites his old jokes and sings the songs he used to perform at weddings. They are all part of the past, all out of work, except for the few waiters who continue to work in small places in the hinterland – like old horses plodding along on crooked, bony legs.</p>

<p>Old Mauritz lies in bed, looking earnestly at the people who have gone through life with him, and listening to their talk. Sima wanders around spitting out curses. She showers the “old parasites” and the “filthy bones” with her words of fire, but the old do not fear her, and Avishel speaks directly to her bitterness:</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Sima, you have become a great Madame...I have even heard that you play on the grand piano!”</p>

<p>With that he begins to move and bang the pots around on the stove. Everyone laughs. Sima curses.</p>

<p>The house grows darker. The old couple do not turn on the lights.</p>

<p>Two old waiters, who live in the <em> moshav-zkaynim</em> (old folks home) play checkers by the dim evening light filtering in through the window. Their two old heads, bent together in the shadows, resemble two dogs sniffing each other over.</p>

<p>Around Mauritz’s bed, the talk of old times gradually dies down, and soon, the aging, sickly men begin their sweet remembrances of women. From time to time, an old lusty laugh is heard, a ticklish giggle. That’s Avishel, recounting the many brides and women that he ‘caught’ at weddings.</p>

<p>Mauritz also has a tale to tell. He thinks that recently, not too long ago, he led astray a big girl from the provinces. He remembers the simple sweetness of her large, powerful limbs. But he says nothing. He suddenly feels that here, in this dark house, someone has entered. Someone dark, hidden and angry, someone who is coming for him! An overpowering sigh escapes his parched lips.</p>

<p>All at once a fuss breaks out over Mauritz’s need for nourishment.</p>
<p class="dialogue"> Avishel pleads with Sima, “Simeshi…Mauritz is so weak, give him something to eat.”</p>

<p class="dialogue">“I can give him my <em>tsores</em> (troubles)”, she answers.</p>

<p class="dialogue">They all fall upon her, like old, smelly dogs. “You are a wicked, malicious, old <i>kazatske </i>(Cossack).</p>

<p>The old one is angry and she begins hissing like a snake.</p>

<p>The friends gather round and dig deep into their pockets. What they find they put together and someone goes out for <em>shnaps</em> (whiskey) and a herring. They bring bagels and drink feverishly from old <em>bankess</em> cups not forgetting to bring a glass to Mauritz, the sick one.</p>

<p>They sit and chew for a long time – without teeth – and are happy again.</p>
