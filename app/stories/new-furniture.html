    Early in the morning Berish wakes with a start and feels an urgent need to run down to the store. He springs up as though someone had thrown him out of
    bed. His eyes are still half-closed, stuck together as in a sleep of confused dreams. Lately, he dreams long and often. Strange, crazy dreams: fears -
    thieves, wild chases, robbers tearing down the doors - everyone running, the whole town, running. And throughout the dream, everything is surrounded by a
    dim light, as if the whole world were lit by a soot-covered lantern.
</p>
<p>
    Now he remains sitting on the edge of the new bed. He rubs his eyes, and only when his bare feet touch the slippery smoothness of the floor, does he
    remember that he is now in his newly-furnished house, where all is up-to-date, shining with gleaming newness. Then he remembers that Rachel is asleep in
    the next bed.
</p>
<p>
    She came in late - thought Berish….I didn’t even hear when…….
</p>
<p>
    Her head was buried in the pillow, and only the barest trace of her hand is visible under the new, shiny comforter.
</p>
<p>
    Only one year had passed since their wedding. It had been during the autumn Succoth festival. Back then, she would wake together with him. And he would
    bring hot milk to her in bed. Those long evenings and nights together….sleeping in one bed. Now she sleeps separately.
</p>
<p>
    All right, let it be. Berish himself understands.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s not healthy,” explained Rachel…perhaps she is right.
</p>
<p>
    “…not healthy,” he had repeated dutifully at the time. Rachel is educated, after all. He sighs now and shakes his head.
</p>
<p>
    Berish goes towards her bed, leans over with longing and looks down upon her tousled, shiny brown hair. He lifts up his hand, lightly touches her shoulder,
    and then, lets his hand drop.
</p>
<p>
    “Rachel,” he murmurs quietly, as if to himself.
</p>
<p>
    He dresses hurriedly, socks and trousers and, with a glance at his sleeping wife, his lips begin mumbling.
</p>
<p>
    Berish has not prayed for almost a year, since he married Rokhche. She is not a religious person. But lately, since the beginning of autumn, when the dawn
    is so grey, when the houses and the trees are etched sharply against the damp mist, and when the leaves fall slowly to the dark, moist earth, suddenly he
    somehow misses praying.
</p>
<p>
    The polished case of the gramophone is on the table. It seems that in the evening, while he was out on the street, there were once again, visitors who
    played music and danced. Suddenly he picks up the gramophone and places it in the corner where it belongs, on the sewing machine. There he sees a few books
    and <em>siddurim</em> (traditional daily prayer books) He takes a book in hand – it is a <em>machzor (</em>a Holy Day prayer book). He wipes the dust off
    and thinks that this will soon be needed. The books are dusty. He opens the door to the hall, and calls out quietly to the kitchen:
</p>
<p>
    “Chana!”
</p>
<p>
    An older peasant woman appears on the threshold. She is sleepy, with red marks on her face. She holds a hand across her bosom, as though suppressing a
    cough:
</p>
<p>
    “What does the Master wish?”
</p>
<p>
    “You see, Chana – here, the books….are so dusty …what is the meaning of this?”
</p>
<p>
    “Madame says they should be taken upstairs to the attic - I don’t know…”
</p>
<p>
    “The attic…why the attic? A Jewish book?”…
</p>
<p>
    Chana stands there, shrugging her shoulders. Suddenly she says:
</p>
<p>
    “There are worse things than that going on here…and the Master worries about books…”
</p>
<p>
    Berish makes no answer.
</p>
<p>
    “The Master would like some tea? The Master will be down soon?”
</p>
<p>
    Berish does not hear.
</p>
<p>
    He goes over and opens the closet, where a strong, holiday odor wafts from her clothes. A forest of clothes, reminding him of the early <em>Yom Tovim</em>
    (Holy Days) when Rachel first came into his home. He suddenly feels that it is all so far away. He stands near the dark, open closet doors, like a
    stranger. He looks for his <em>tallis </em>(prayer shawl) bag, and feels a sudden need to reassure himself that it has not been forsaken and dusty, like
    the books.
</p>
<p>
    This <em>Yom Kippur,</em> (Day of Atonement) - may we live, he thinks to himself. He wants to start over - from this very <em>Yom Kippur</em> – for all
    things to be as before. He longs for his former life, and pulling his <em>tallis</em> bag out from a heap of old, creased clothing, he leans deeper into
    the closet.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>tallis</em> bag was made of brown velvet, with an embroidered cover.
</p>
<p>
    How long has it been, since Brakhele embroidered this <em>tallis</em> bag for him? She was just a young girl then, and Berish a young man of twenty. The
    gloomy light entering through the window, the <em>tallis</em> bag, together with his thoughts of the coming <em>Yom Kippur</em>, brought before him the
    face of his first wife, Brakhele.
</p>
<p>
    Berish was once again engulfed by the memory of the cemetery, which lay between the gray fields, behind the town, across the highway. He was suddenly
    suffused with a warm religious feeling, like the light touch of a bird, hovering over him from a distant height. Berish took the <em>tallis</em> bag and
    dug his fingers into the soft plush, as though this firm grasp would protect him.
</p>
<p>
    He placed the <em>tallis</em> bag near the books in the corner, and quickly donned his hat.
</p>
<p>
    The servant, Chana, once again entered the room. By now she had warmed up by the fire in the kitchen. Her wig was combed and arranged. She placed a glass
    of pale tea and a pot of milk on the table. Without looking at her, Berish said:
</p>
<p>
    “Chana, these things need cleaning….<em>Yomtov</em> is coming…here is the <em>tallis</em> bag…”
</p>
<p>
    He wished to say more, but felt that Chana was trying to ask him something. But instead of speaking, the sleepy woman turned around suddenly and with a
    groan, disappeared.
</p>
<p>
    Berish stands and strokes his short, tobacco-stained beard. With his other hand, he stirs the glass of tea. He hears Chana answer the door. This was
    Leibel, the servant who came for the keys to open up the shop. Berish wanted to tell him something, but he had forgotten what it was. He hurriedly sips his
    tea, opens the drawer and takes out a heavy bunch of keys. He goes to the door where the servant stands waiting.
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll be right down,” Berish said.
</p>
<p>
    The servant was red-faced and the odor of cold apples wafted up from his body. A large crusty bun stuck out of his pocket.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s late,” Berish said out of habit. “When Yoel comes, he must get to the train.”
</p>
<p>
    His mind was bursting with numerous business deals, thoughts of money and materials.
</p>
<p>
    He had no reason to stay around the house. Yet, something holds him back. He stands near the window and watches the town come to life with work-a-day
    bustle and activity. He stands near the window and looks out at the slowly awakening street; the small town had begun its day. The mist began to lift.
    Several wagons arrive from the station. They are all so familiar that Berish can even recognize the horses. Familiar people, neighbors all warmly wrapped,
    pass by.
</p>
<p>
    The old street, which Berish knows from childhood, begins to look as always. In the opposite windows, he could pinpoint all of the old, familiar people.
    Chaim, the water-carrier, harnessed the large drum to his horse and wagon. On high, over the rooftops, where thin-branched chestnut trees swayed, the
    whiteness of the new houses, with the church in their midst, was etched. The new metal roofs shone with a sharp, white gleam. That must be the roof of the
    new bank, just completed this year. This new section of town, which had only this year been established, has now become the center.
</p>
<p>
    There, near the church, rose the shining new city. Exactly opposite Berish's window, on the hill, the new city grew from day to day. Magnificent aged trees
    from the old park separated the two parts of the city, and Berish imagines that the new city on the hill seems to advance, like a fresh, shining army -
    especially at night when the tall metal lampposts stand at attention like a regiment - cold slices of artificial moonlight. The new Kino sends out red and
    green rays of advertisements over the dark treetops, and the music that pours forth from there seems to him a continuous parade.
</p>
<p>
    For Berish, that part of the city remained strange and distant. He knew no one there, and all his life and work resided in the older, darker streets of his
    town. Only Rachel returned very late at night from this bright part of the city. Every evening her girlfriends and acquaintances streamed forth from those
    new houses. With each passing day, more and more new friends appear. Berish doesn’t know any of them. Only last week, the elegant Doctor K., looking
    fastidious and full of vigor, came to the house from an unknown distant town to see his Rachel, as well as the two sons of the wealthy manufacturer, E.L.
    Berish never understands what connection they had to his Rachel. It's true that Rachel is educated and good-looking, had studied in a large city and simply
    knew how to get along with people. Berish never bothered her or denied her money…she must never be sad or lonely…she should have nice clothes…after all,
    she is young …as he pondered his own forty-five years. And he thought that the child that was missing from his life must be here, somewhere, in one of the
    many corners of his newly furnished house. For the last year, since he brought Rachel home, he has been painfully aware of how everything changed. Everyone
    went there - to the new streets, to the glimmering part of town - and she had become distant and strange to him. The guests that come to the house, to
    Rachel, call him "Panya Berish", and when they find him at home they mumble excuses to leave.
</p>
<p>
    But as soon as he leaves, the house immediately fills again with noise, music from the gramophone, song and dance.
</p>
<p>
    His old friends, the Tenenbaums, and the Rubensteins - with whom he went to <em>cheder (</em>religious school) and did business with for years after, have
    also become strange and distant. Now, he remembers that on more than one occasion, they had raised sharp comments about his Rachel, who lived such an
    ‘aristocratic’ life. And the Charity Fund Organization in which he had been active for so many years with other respected Jews, had lately withdrawn his
    name from the board, and he had felt bereft.
</p>
<p>
    "Foolishness," he tried to calm himself, and his glance fell on Rachel’s silk stockings, thrown carelessly on the floor. He approached the bed and
    stretched out his hand toward Rachel’s head. She suddenly awoke and opened her eyes. Her skin was magnificent, warmed by the scent of perfume:
</p>
<p>
    “Berish….What are you doing here now? It's so late…”
</p>
<p>
    She yawned. Berish stands forlorn, idle hands dangling by his sides and, as always, when near her young, strong and marvelous body, he feels small and
    weak.
</p>
<p>
    She looks at him again, and once more asks:
</p>
<p>
    “Why don't you go down to the shop already?…It's late.”
</p>
<p>
    “I wanted to wait until you woke up, Rachel.”
</p>
<p>
    “That's a new one,” she said, and once again yawned.
</p>
<p>
    At that moment, Chana answered the door, and someone spoke very quietly.
</p>
<p>
    Berish quickly moved into the hallway. From the corner of his eye, he caught sight of one of the manufacturer's two sons, the tall, dark one.
</p>
<p>
    Berish suddenly experienced a deep, sharp dizzying stab, as though coming from on high.
</p>
<p>
    Chana stood before him and motioned with her hand. Her eyes glowered in the dim hallway, and with pursed lips, said:
</p>
<p>
    “…came already….he thought that you had already gone down…”
</p>
<p>
    “Who? What?...What does he want?...Chana?”
</p>
<p>
    “What does he want?…Ay ay…blind people…”
</p>
<p>
    Chana suddenly turned pale and went to stand in the darkest corner of the hallway, from which she blurted out:
</p>
<p>
    “You think about books, about an old <em>tallis</em> bag…Woe unto me and my eyes, what I have seen here…”
</p>
<p>
    Berish heaved his body heavily against the smooth, whitewashed wall.
</p>
<p>
    It was a comfort - to have the wall against his back, holding him up.<a name="_GoBack"></a>
