		Two ample women wearing large head shawls stood chattering in front of the workshop window.  Placing their hands on their foreheads, they peered through the dusty window, straining to see a whitish hint of a face.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“He’s there!” one of them cried out.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both women, like old crooked birds, ran to the side street where a young woman stood.  She was wearing a new hat, pressed flatly down on her full head of thick hair.  All three began to walk down the town’s furthest tree-lined street, among the old Polish houses.
	</p>
	<p>
		The two old women dragged the girl with them, waving their hands. They pushed her and shoved her back and forth, until the girl, holding her parasol like a rifle at her side, began to run.
	</p>
	<p>
		She ran straight back to the low, dark door of the workshop.  There, she stood looking,  mouth agape, at the sign upon which sacks of flour, like a pile of squashed cushions were painted. She wiped her face, smoothed the hair under her hat, and with a rhythmic, dancing step pushed the door open before her, as the bell gave out a thin tinny sound.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Rifke found herself in the murky dimness of the flour warehouse.  At first she was unable to see anything, even though a thin ray of light came from the depths of the long corridor.  Only when the shadow of a person appeared right next to her, was she able to ask: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Are you Simkha?"
	</p>
	<p>
		She was finally able to discern a tall young man with a pale face, flour-clouded glasses over his eyes.  He wore a gray, flour-covered <em>kapot</em> (kaftan) and a pencil was stuck behind one ear.  	
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Yes, I am he."
	</p>
	<p>
		He began to rub his hands, creating a huge dust cloud of flour. Somewhere in this gray-white dimness, appeared another shadow entirely covered with flour.  Rifke could not make out who this was.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few minutes, Simkha  ran down and  opened a door on the far side.  A ray of light streamed in, which enabled Rifke to more clearly make out the huge warehouse.  Flour sacks were piled up high - to the rafters, like massive hills. Only then could she recognize a second figure, breathing heavily, as he pulled himself along.  He was an old, gentile peasant, with a long moustache and, on his head, a flour-covered hat that seemed part of him.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Rifke remained standing while Simkha ran back and forth, causing a whirl of flour dust:  
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Please come,” he said, and carefully, lest the flour should fall on her, led her to a long table.
	</p>

	<p>
		There sat a weighing device, and several empty sacks.  He moved a stool towards her, and wiped it with the underside of his kaftan.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Please sit…”
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Thank you very much. I was passing...so I decided to come in."
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Yes, I understand. Are you this <em>fraulein</em>?"
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Who told you? Well, yes... it’s a different world today. But don’t think that I’ve come all alone. They are waiting outside.”
	</p>
	<p>
		The young man placed his hand on his heart and genty said:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“The matchmakers come every day... but why is it necessary? Since you came here alone, isn’t it best that we get to know one another?”
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Quite right,” smiled the girl, revealing her large yellowish teeth and wide mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
		She was half-seated on the bench. Holding her parasol, she looked around.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“And so, this is your business?”
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Yes, and I have two more storage cellars"
	</p>
	<p>
		The girl blinked and thrust forth a thick leg from beneath her dress.
		The young man bent over her, leaning on the table.  She was breathing heavily, her large bosom heaving.
	</p>
	<p>
		They looked at one another and he said:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“This is the way I prefer. I dislike the matchmakers. Believe me, they have been breaking down the doors...ever since she died. Have you seen the living quarters, the house?”
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"No..." she answered.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"So we shall soon go and see."
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		She put down her parasol.  She felt that she had to say something now, and out of the confusion of her mind she blurted out:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"And so?"
	</p>
	<p>
		He visibly shivered, as though caught in the midst of a theft.  He stole a quiet overall look at her strong arms, and a warm flow of blood slowly rose  to a quiet roar within him, deafening his ears. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Rifke was still unable to see his face clearly. She thought to herself—‘a real man’—and her strong heart began to beat. At that very moment, she wished to react with passion. She looked for a word, but he did not allow her to rest, and coming closer, said:  
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“So let us go into the house...it’s right here…we simply have to go through this door.”
	</p>
	<p>
		She got up and they both went towards the ray of light that streamed through the chamber. From every corner, the gray sacks of flour looked on, mutely. The dry flour dust gave off an oppressive odor. Soon there appeared a dark corridor, which led to a window facing a small, dingy gray yard. Suddenly he opened a door and Rifke saw a large bright kitchen. Her eyes were immediately drawn to three bright copper pots, projecting a rosy glow on the wall. Pots and pans, glasses and dishes, tin and brass and iron shone from every corner. A ticklish quiver ran over the girl’s skin. 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		<em> What a well of riches this is</em>, she thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		He saw her flushed face and neck, and allowed himself to hold her closely under the arm and lead her into a second room. There she saw a sideboard with shining glass panes and a table and chairs. All this clearly appealed to her comforting glance. Now she simply did not see him—but only counted the chairs round the table, and the many other details around her.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue"> 
		<em>A treasure, a treasure…. I struck it rich!</em>, she kept thinking.
	</p>
	<p>
		She touched the tablecloth, stroking it gently. On the table lay a bread roll and knife on a plate. She looked over everything lovingly, and felt a wistful pity for her own plight. Suddenly, her glance fell upon an enlarged photograph in a golden frame. The photo showed a dark, frightened young woman, straight bangs covering her small forehead. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The young man caught her look and quietly said:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"That is she..."
	</p>
	<p>
		Rifke frowned and said:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"One can see that she was not strong."
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Yes, yes..." Simkha stood for a moment with his head down, but soon he was reminded of something and murmured to Rifke: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Let us go further."
	</p>
	<p>
		Once again, he held her arm and led her into a side room, where a red floor and rosy oil-painted walls gleamed. The room held a dead silence and a bitter loneliness. Two large beds stood in the center of the room, covered by a huge, soft comforter.
	</p>
	<p>
		“A love-nest,” thought Rifke worriedly, and began to retreat.  She noticed that the door had closed behind her and, turning to run, fell against the young man.  As she touched him, she felt his trembling, and quickly looked into his face. 
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment, the voice of the old peasant was heard, his high-pitched, casual voice called out for the <em>balebos</em>. He stood there, like a sack of flour, wearing high flour-covered boots, and with his great white finger, beckoned:  “Panye Simkha”.
	</p>
	<p>
		The young man roused himself. He held Rifke’s hand for the first time saying:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		 “I beg you…please stay here for a minute...make yourself at home...I’ll be back soon." And he left the house.
	</p>
	<p>
		As soon as he left, the girl looked over the whole house with a passion.
		She grabbed her face and dug her fingers into her cheeks.  Thoughts whirled round her head at all she saw:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		<em>A house….a complete house, with all one needs.</em> This kept ringing in her mind as she thought: <em>Rifke...Rifke...don’t let this go.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		 Her gaze rested on the night table next to the bed. Without knowing why, she pulled out a small drawer revealing a shiny gold watch held by a long gold chain. She became frightened, pushed the drawer closed, and thought that there must be a closet near the bed...or in the boxes or perhaps the small table...there must be money, a lot of money. Her cheeks were flaming red, and she felt the strange sensation of flying, being so close to such great luck. She did not want to remain in the bedroom. The two covered beds disturbed her, but she simply could not cross the threshold of the room...and Simkha had still not returned.
	</p>
	<p>
		Her heart was beating as if she were a thief. She wanted this house at any price. <em>An orphan has luck</em> she thought. <em> God must help an orphan</em>.
		And all the difficult years living with her aunt in town, her hard work for the stingy hands of her angry blue-lipped aunt...all these fearful years arose in her mind, a torment.
	</p>
	<p>
		She felt a feverish heat upon her, and unbuttoned the clasps of her jacket, revealing the light covering of her ample bosom. She felt her skin and thought: <em>I will please him.</em> She felt this in her body, and purposely remained in the bedroom, feeling that this corner of the house was the best reminder of his wife’s absence.
	</p>
	<p>
		A long time passed, but Rifke did not feel uncomfortable at being left alone.  She kept recalling and counting the contents of the house, and in her mind she mumbled repeatedly: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		A widower without children is even better than a young man.
	</p>
	<p>
		This thought occurred to her almost as if someone had relayed the information from her ear directly into her mind. Finally, when he returned, she actually looked at him for the first time. She tried to think what might be the best thing to say to him.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“I ask you...how can you leave a strange person alone here?  I see that you can easily be robbed...”
	</p>
	<p>
		He looked at her unbuttoned jacket.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Please excuse me...for me, you are no longer a stranger.”
	</p>
	<p>
		She pretended not to understand.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“What do you mean...not a stranger?” she replied, laughing lightly. “We have only just begun to know one another.”
	</p>
	<p>
		She waited for his answer, which would indicate a great deal to her.
	</p>
	<p>
		He looked at her in confusion and suddenly, with a strange heaviness, fell upon her. She saw his face with his half-closed eyes wildly close to her. And before she could gather herself together, she fell backwards onto the bed. The bed was soft, and she fell so deeply that her knees sprung up, and he fell on top of her. Something ripped in her dress, and the sleeve of the jacket became tangled. His broad hand was half covering her mouth and nose, and a dry, stuffy smell came from his flour-covered hand. She tried with all her might to stand up, but the deep soft bed simply held her down. Something strange happened to her and one clear thought overcame all else: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		<em>The house is mine...mine...</em> It seemed as if the whole house turned round and fell on her with a strange, sweet heaviness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rifke saw before her eyes the small narrow bed at her aunt’s house, and the damp sour smell of the cold, wet floor. Her hands rested on the soft comforter, and near her lay Simkha’s head. His hair was dishevelled and his hand lay on her breast. The room was bright, and she saw the shine of her new silk stockings.  She remembered where she had bought the stockings.
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		Suddenly, Simkha sprang up. She watched him straighten out his boots, and run from one corner of the room the other. Footsteps were heard from the other room.  Perhaps they were calling for Simkha again. She heard him speaking with someone, and she quickly got up. Simkha came into the bedroom and spoke with a crooked smile: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Heh, the matchmakers have come…”
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“A curse upon me”, cried Rifke, and began weeping loudly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Simkha ran to her and embraced her, wishing to stop her tears. He kissed her, caressed her tenderly and spoke into her ear: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“Don’t cry...it will all be fine...you’ll see...nu, shush, shush."
	</p>
	<p>
		Only now did Rifke let out a truly heartfelt whimper: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		“What did you want from me? I am an orphan!”
	</p>
	<p>
		Simkha sprang up to close the door, but the two old women were standing on the other side. Rifke could hear their hissing chatter. She heard one of them cry out: 
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"What have you done with the girl?"
	</p>
	<p>
		Rifke thought no more and, springing from the room, stood firm between 
		Simkha and the two women at the door, shouting: “Nu?”
	</p>
	<p>
		The women frowned and waited with pointed, pursed mouths.
	</p>
	<p>
		The girl shot a fiery glance at Simkha. He hid his eyes, but she repeated herself once again: “Nu?”
	</p>
	<p> Simkha raised his head, as if to sneeze, and said: “Well, we are now groom and bride.”
	</p>
	<p>
		The two old women clapped their hands and cried out happily:
	</p>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"Mazel tov! Mazel tov!"
	</p>
