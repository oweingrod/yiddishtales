<p>VERY PERSONAL REGARDS
A  LEBEDIKER  GRUS
By E. Kaganovski</p>
<p>I wandered around the station platform with the nonchalance of a passenger without baggage.  I was traveling to take care of some business details, but mainly because it was the beginning of spring.  Everything was green and blooming, and a wonderful fragrance wafted up from beyond the town.  It seemed as though I were on the way to a concert that played itself out in the fields and side roads along the way.  Even stronger was the feeling of some palpable promise - like the endless blue summer sky - of sweet discovery, a longing that only beats in young, healthy and happy hearts…</p>
<p>There were still a few minutes left before the train would depart, and I had time to observe the hurrying passengers.  Suddenly, I saw a young man wearing a familiar student’s hat; I recognized him from Jewish ‘intellectual’ circles.  His pale eyes squinted forcefully through the lenses of his glasses, as he scanned the platform.  Letter in hand, he took one look at me as though I were the very one he sought and, lifting his hat, called out my name:
“May I know if you might be going to Goor?”
“Yes, I am going to Goor.”
“Excuse me, but we are somewhat acquainted….my name is…”
He blurted out his name and blushed deeply, saying:</p>
<p>“You are in a position to do me a great favor.  There is a family there, well, actually my betrothed’s family.  I would greatly appreciate your delivering them a personal greeting from me.  They have asked me so often.  If you would only do this: it is a small town,  they are lovely people, a grand house.  You will be happily taken care of.  Ah, they would be so happy!”</p>
<p>I felt good and  light-hearted.  I thought for a moment before answering, picturing the 
‘grand house’, the lovely people, the prospective bride.  The young man smiled in a timid, childish way as he awaited my answer.</p>
<p>“Fine,” I said, “you would like me to actually give them the letter in person - alright, fine!”</p>
<p>The young man shook my hand, and quickly wrote a few words on the back of the envelope.  I entered the carriage, and his grateful look lingered in my mind.  I sat down and took the envelope out of my pocket.  I read the address and the additional penciled words – ‘This letter is delivered by my friend (here my name was written), my good friend.’  </p>
<p> I took pains to try and recall where I had possibly met the young man.<br>Yet, he certainly had had no trouble recognizing me – faster than I could remember him.
And as I looked around at my companions in the carriage, I soon forgot about the young man and the letter.</p>
<p>I arrived in the town of Goor around eleven o’clock at night.  This was a small provincial Russian town full of green-tiled rooftops.  The moon shone down with springtime fullness, etching the edges of the houses in white light.  A balmy breeze blew softly, and springtime was in the air, gurgling like fresh wine from the earth.  From every hedge and every tree branches murmured their awakening, slowly coming to life.  The streets were already empty, but it seemed as if people had not sunk into a deep sleep, but rather a light, happy and refreshing slumber. </p>
<p>This new strange place aroused my curiosity.  Despite the hours of travel, I remained alert and wandered from street to street.  I saw numerous shadows in the darker corners of the small streets.  Beneath the trees, several couples lingered, and a sweet sense of longing for love, which sometimes happens in strange towns, enveloped me.  Here in this new town, I was filled with a pleasurable loneliness as well as a wistful sense of envy. </p>
<p>At that moment, I remembered the young man’s letter to his bride-to-be.  I had the urge to actually go to their house, but the late hour kept me from doing so.  I took out the letter, and by the bright street light, I was able to see the address.  On impulse, I decided to seek out the house.  I soon stood before a tall one-story house with thick, well-built green shutters.  All was dark and quiet in the house, while the surrounding garden was clearly lit by the moon.  After circling the house a few times, I later found a hotel, took a room, and soon fell fast asleep with youthful fatigue.
                                                                  *
When I opened my eyes in the morning, a fine sunny day shone through the window.
I had slept late, and when I saw the lively street through the window – people going to and fro – I hurriedly got dressed.  I was soon ready to go out and arrange the few bits of business I had, and see the people I had arranged to meet.  Before I left, I turned to the hotel-keeper and asked:
“Would you know the family whose address is on this envelope?” 
“What a question!  Of course I know them.  Ah, what a fine house and family.”
“Well, and the daughter?”
“Ah, the Fraulein?  Yes, a lovely girl, and educated.  She has a groom…a student..”
“Yes, yes, she has a groom, a student.  Would you kindly take this letter to them and say that the bearer of this letter has greetings for them from the student – the prospective groom?”</p>
<p>The owner’s helper took the letter and departed.
I went off to take care of my business and was busy in town until late afternoon.  When I returned to the hotel, no sooner had I crossed the threshold, when the hotel owner and the young lad met me to say that the family had already come twice looking for me.  They begged me to wait because in the evening, the young Fraulein would come herself and receive the regards from me personally.  I lay down to rest on my bed, but could not fall asleep.  Unwillingly, I began to wait for her.  I was sorry that I had not taken the letter to them myself.  It was, however, too late, and I waited impatiently…</p>
<p>Thus a few hours passed, as I tossed from side to side on the narrow hotel bed. The window panes were soon rosy with the glow of the sinking sun.  And still the Fraulein did not come.  My business matters were taken care of, and this silly waiting for this unfamiliar girl spoiled my mood.  I felt that the matter was already taken care of, the letter delivered and all was complete.  However, I kept hearing the pleading voice of the student, who so wished me to give a personal  greeting  ( the devil take him) to his bride-to be.  So why didn’t she come??</p>
<p>It was very dark outside when I finally left the hotel.  I thought of leaving that evening.
A warm wind blew outside, bringing with it the smell of new-grown grass.  The rooftops were gilded with a reddish glow, and in the dark sky shone a round mirror-like moon.  The world felt ‘yomtovdik’ (festive) and happy.</p>
<p>I studied the faces of every young woman I passed, thinking this might be the Fraulein,  come to ‘collect’ the greeting.  They also looked at me with the curiosity aroused by a stranger’s presence in the provinces.  I walked a great deal and slowly my mood began to improve.  All at once I found myself standing in front of the same family house where I had stood the night before.  I recognized the green shutters and the garden, and the thought occurred to me that I might very simply go in, convey the greeting and leave.</p>
<p>I went up three stairs and rang the bell.  The door to the hallway soon opened. 
Before me, stood a young peasant woman, blond hair covering her forehead. 
She looked at me with a frightened smile in her light peasant eyes.
“Is this the house of the M. family?”
“Yes, yes, this is it…”
“Is the Fraulein at home?”</p>
<p>The servant did not answer.  She sprang away with a soft thud of her heavy bare feet and called out:  “Barinya (Madam) ….A Barin (gentleman) is asking….”
At this point, an older woman with gray hair and large dark eyes appeared.
She looked at me for a moment with great excitement and then smiled:
“So this is the Herr…the one that brought the letter…from Misha…Please,
be good enough to enter.  I am the mother.  Oh, what a shame…my daughter
wanted to see you…we are so thankful to you, please...sit.”</p>
<p>She took me into a large, comfortable dining room with dark rugs covering the floor.
On a smaller table nearby stood a large samovar, and all bespoke of a good, old established household.</p>
<p>“Sit, I beg of you, here on the sofa where it’s more comfortable.  Perhaps some tea?
“Varke!” she called to the maid.   “So she didn’t get to see you - my daughter?  What a shame that you didn’t meet. Varke, run over to the Liebermans to see if the barishnye (young lady) is there, or to the doctor.  Tell her to come home now…we are waiting for her.  Ah, what a welcome guest.  We have been speaking about you all day.  Is it really possible?  Misha’s good friend!”</p>
<p>She opened the door to a side room and shouted:<br>“Motye , Motye, come in here…we have a guest!”</p>
<p>A minute later, at the threshold of the room, stood a Jew of about fifty, a tall, 
thin man with a fine dark beard and delicate gold-rimmed glasses and red, young lips.<br>He was wearing a long night wrap, and seemed to have awoken from a nap.</p>
<p>He stretched out a heavy, gaunt hand, threw back his head saying in a kind soft voice:
“Welcome, my man, when did you arrive?  You must be tired from the journey.  Would you like to lie down?”</p>
<p>He seemed very pleased which made me feel good as well.  Only one strange feeling made me uncomfortable –the fact that I could not recall the name of the ‘groom’ - the unfamiliar student about whom I knew nothing.  I got up and quietly said:
“Thank you, but I am leaving soon.  I only wanted to give you real and personal regards from, from your ‘groom-to-be’.  I saw him and  well…”</p>
<p>Suddenly they both rushed up to me and grabbed my hands:
“What do you mean you are leaving so soon?  And we should let you go, so coldly?
Misha’s friend…what do you mean?  He is like our own child, and you, his good friend!”</p>
<p>I stood there, smiling foolishly, but they sat me down again, with loving care.
They took away my hat, which I had held in my hand, and the woman, in one minute, began filling the table with baked goods, sweets and jams.   They forcibly sat me down at the table, the father brought out cigars while the mother bustled around trying to serve me.</p>
<p>The older man looked at me through his delicate glasses.  He settled himself deeply into the armchair and, playing with his long, white aristocratic fingers, asked sharply, searching for the right words with his red, womanly lips:
“And so what does Misha do there?  He studies…right?  Perhaps you learn together?”
“No, I no longer study.  Actually I came here on business, but I happened to see him.”
“What do you mean ‘saw him?  He writes here that you will give us regards…and Misha’s friend is like a relative for us, one of our own.  So tell us, how does he look?  Is he well taken care of?  Studying is hard on the brain.  Tell me, is he making progress?”
“Yes,” I replied, “He looks good.”  I wanted to add something, so I said: “He seemed very happy to learn that I was coming this way.”</p>
<p>I looked around the house.  From every corner a sense of comfortable well-being radiated.  The old furniture was well fitted to the walls, and the wooden floor shone with a marked, trodden glow.</p>
<p>We were all quiet for a moment.  They seemed to be waiting for me to tell them more about Misha. Finally the older man spoke up: “And so what else can you tell us?”
“Yes” I began again.  “So I saw him and that was fine.”
“And how are his eyes?  What did the doctor say?”  the older woman asked.</p>
<p>“Not bad,” I answered.  “He doesn’t complain.”
And in order to continue the discussion, I added:  “A fine young man”. 
“What do you mean ‘a fine young man?  He is an angel.  God willing, he shall soon finish his studies.”
“He will complete them,” I agreed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the servant approached saying that she had looked for the young lady everywhere, but could not find her.
The mother was beside herself:  “Ach, such an absent-minded one…..a girl loses herself”!
She tried to explain to me:  “You understand, she is lonely, and this is a small town”.</p>
<p>However, I was surprised that she didn’t trouble herself to meet me, since she knew I was bringing greetings from her khosen – her prospective groom.  I finished drinking the glass of tea, and slowly gathered my things up and made ready to leave.
“Well, I shall be off now.”</p>
<p> Whereupon there was a great fuss and bustle all around me.  The mother and father arose as one and barred my way.   At that same moment, a young man with a smiling wife entered, looking at me with broad, happy faces.  These were also relatives, who all spoke at once:
“Why are you hurrying?  The place here is fine, and the girl wants to see you; she’s dying to see you. Sit, we have sent word to our friends and the family, and in a moment our daughter will return.” </p>
<p> My pleas and excuses - that I must leave today - were ignored. They were seated all around me, like at a ‘simcha’- a holiday – and each one began anew to ask after Misha.  Now I realized that a mere few words would not help, and I began to think up news: how we see each other often, are the best of friends, and more…whatever came into my mind.  They asked whether he had received their parcel, whether the ‘homen-tashen’ – a Purim delicacy – had been fresh and the butter unspoiled.
And for each question I had to give a clear answer.
Thus, a few hours passed, but the ‘Fraulein’ still did not appear.  I had to promise, however, that I would not leave that day, and I left the house accompanied by many friendly faces.</p>
<p>I did not feel like going straight to the hotel, and I circled the boulevard a few times, again noticing young men and girls together.   Later in the evening, I returned to the hotel.  No sooner had I crossed the threshold, when the hotel keeper and his assistant stood in front of me with an especially enthusiastic plea:  the ‘Fraulein’ had come looking for me.  She was disappointed that she had missed me, and promised to return the next morning.</p>
<p>I no longer thought about leaving.  The young woman seemed to me to be a riddle.
I was curious about this magical circle that had woven itself around us, but had not allowed us to meet.  Once again, I spent a sleepless night.  As dawn broke, and the sun came out, I could no longer sleep.  I get dressed, tidied my belongings, and called down to have the room cleaned in preparation for meeting the young woman.  And so the hours passed until twelve noon. I realized that I was wasting my time waiting, and she would no longer come.  I decided to go to the house for the last time, say my good-byes and leave.  I paid the hotel bill, and went out to the street.  I did not want to leave without saying goodbye to the people who had so warmly welcomed me.</p>
<p>The truth was, however, that I was simply curious about this seemingly unreachable woman.  I wished for some idea of her face, because I knew that the young man, her ‘groom’, would seek me out, and hope for a letter in return.  I rang their doorbell once more:  “Is the ‘Fraulein here?”, I asked pointedly.</p>
<p>A search immediately started throughout the house.  They were all sure that she was around somewhere.  Perhaps in the garden?  Perhaps in her bedroom?  Once again, she was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>I began to say my farewells – and again – father, mother, a young man and a neighbor lady began to plead with me, begging me to stay, at least until after lunch:
“We are certain…we counted on you…she shall be here soon.”</p>
<p>And in the midst of the whole scene of friendly endearments and attempted farewells, they suddenly shouted: “She is here!  The ‘barishnya’ – the young lady is here!  Fraulein Bella has arrived!”</p>
<p>In a few moments, the young woman appeared  in the doorway of the second room. </p>
<p>*
A young woman of about twenty-five or twenty-six, with a head full of heavy dark curls came forward.  Her high, shapely eyebrows hovered above softly shadowed eyes, and a succulent, blood-red mouth.  She approached me with a faint smile and, throwing back her head, stretched out a warm, full, soft hand to me: </p>
<p>“Ah, excuse me, my good man….I am so ‘scatter-brained’…you must excuse my wild ways…..I often have these awful confusions….”</p>
<p>She looked at me directly, and beneath her long, soft eyelashes, her fresh moist lips pouted.  Around us, the people of the house stood and stared.  With her appearance they seemed to await a new interest in me.  The mother attempted to answer for her:
“You understand?  These young people,  they seem to have a restless wind blowing through their heads….”</p>
<p>Again I stood there, almost forgetting what had brought me here.  I barely remembered the pale, young man, the student Misha, with his letter and his greetings.  Around me they bustled, preparing the mid-day meal.  The ‘Fraulein’ disappeared for a few minutes, and returned wearing a light, simple dress.  The father was already seated at the head of the table, and the meal began.  The girl sat opposite, looking at me, and suddenly in a happy, lively voice, asked:</p>
<p>“And so, what do you hear about Misha?”, and a light blush covered her face.  “Please understand me if I plague you with questions.” </p>
<p>I simply did not know what to say.  Then the old man said:
“Let the gentleman eat, then you two can talk.  He will not leave so early.  Your train
leaves quite late at night.”
“Oh, excuse me”, she apologized with a laugh.</p>
<p>The conversation took many turns around the table….about the town from which I came, why I came, and what business I was in, and gradually the subject came round to Misha – that he must take care of his eyes, his weak eyes.</p>
<p>I kept assuring them that his eyes were fine, which comforted the old people.  Thus, the meal was enjoyed to the end – a very fine meal indeed.   The father retired to nap.  The room became quiet and shaded, and only the window slats allowed slices of late afternoon light to enter.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you would like to lie down?” asked the mother.
The young woman stretched her arms, gathered her hair, and softly sang a romantic Russian song.
I thanked them.
“If not,” said Bella, “we can go into my room and talk.”</p>
<p>A dainty white room as befits a wealthy, small-town daughter, with walls covered in various announcements and invitations;  a portrait of Tolstoy and Gorky, as well as photos of students, among which I barely found a likeness of Misha.  I looked at the pale, yellowing provincial photograps and searched for something to tell the girl.   She sat down next to me on a comfortable yellow sofa, and with a downward look, asked quietly:
“When did you last see him?”</p>
<p>I looked at her, and suddenly wanted to blurt out the whole truth – that my friendship with Misha was coincidental, a hazy vague recollection.  However, I felt I would lose her warm, friendly look.  So I answered, almost choking on the few inadequate words:
“At the station, that is, we met by accident, because he did not know I was coming here.”</p>
<p> She was quiet, as though this clarified things for her.  She did not speak for a long while, quietly singing ‘coquettishly’ and moving her full mouth.</p>
<p>I blurted out: “So, what shall I tell you?  You surely know more about him, men are not so open with each other.  Now, when I see you, I understand him better than before, for I see his great possession.  I see that his reality is something I envy.”
She suddenly laughed:  “You are jealous of him?”
“Yes, I must admit, I am.”
We looked at each other with happy smiles:
“He never spoke of me?”
I was taken aback at the sudden question and said: “He has a kind of hidden nature, Misha.” 
“Hidden?  I think not.” she responded.
“Well, understandably he spoke of you, but that is not all…”</p>
<p>Towards the end of our talk, I told her about the big city.  My stories lifted her, and from time to time the name of Misha threaded it’s way into the conversation, but less and less.
She wanted to hear about me.  We soon recalled happy and tragic moments, which I rendered with a poetic touch.  She believed me and devoured my stories.</p>
<p>It was by now quite dark in the room, when soft footsteps were heard, followed by a light tap on the door.  The mother opened the door, and with clear, light eyes said:  </p>
<p>“Bellatchke, please ask the guest to take tea with us; the samovar is already on the table.”</p>
<p>It was not easy to rise from the comfortable yellow sofa and shatter the quiet relaxed hour of provincial tranquility.  The girl read this in my look and, with an excited smile, spoke into my eyes: 
“We will continue talking, yes?  You won’t hurry away…”  And she took me lightly by the arm.
*
On the table stood a grand, shiny nickel-plated samovar, boiling and wafting its gleaming presence - of purity and cleanliness - around the table.  The father was already seated, reading a newspaper:  “Well, my daughter, have you received a good greeting?”
“Yes, Papa,” she answered, winking at me, “We spent the whole time talking of Misha.”
And once again, our glances met.</p>
<p>As before, several family members and neighbors came to tea.  Again the conversation came back to talk and questions concerning Misha and his studies.  When everyone arose from the table a lamp was lit, although one could still catch glimpses of blue sky through the shades.  At that point ‘Fraulein’ Bella turned to me:
“Perhaps we could take a little walk down the boulevard?  It’s such a lovely evening!”
Thus, followed by our friends’ approving looks, we left the house.</p>
<p>The street lamps down the length of the boulevard glistened with a dewy night haze.
From somewhere came the sound of mandolins; from the surrounding fields and gardens a sweet smell of grass and blossoms.  We walked together, feeling one another’s rhythmic steps.
“Come, let us go to the Castle” she said.</p>
<p>I was led through a thick small path lined with huge tall trees.  From afar one could see the tops of turrets, like broken birds.  A deep, silken darkness spread before us, and an everlasting quiet engulfed us.  As we clambered over hills and rocks between the ruins, she would often take my arm.  This drove a deep desire in me to press her arm to mine.
She said, however, at that moment:  “This is where Misha and I often stroll”.</p>
<p>The name Misha began to irritate me….this strange person who stood between us.
She somehow managed to mention his name at every opportunity.  She spoke of his goodness, of his faithfulness, and always added: “You just don’t know what a good and righteous person he is.”</p>
<p>When we returned to the main street of the town, a late moon filled the sky.  The street was full of people.  She stood close to me as we walked and we drew the notice of the many passers-by, who seemed to know of me, and boldly looked me in the eye.</p>
<p>As we walked, I decided that I must leave late that night.  We got nearer to the house, and I felt increasingly tired.  There were still another few hours before the train departed.  In order to pass the time, and somehow repay the generosity of my good hosts, I stopped in front of a brightly lit coffee house.</p>
<p>“You would not refuse to join me in a cup of coffee? Before I leave?”
“Only if you promise not to leave before having supper with us.”<br> She graciously and naturally entered the café.</p>
<p>The coffee house was practically empty.  Only a few military types were around.
The owner brought us coffee and pastry and returned to his drowsy position at the buffet.
We sat and chatted over coffee.  She told me that she came to the café often with girlfriends and others…“but not just with ‘anyone’”, she added with provincial charm.
This was by way of telling me that she was not a stay-at-home, and she quickly added:  “But don’t tell Misha, because he would be so concerned.” </p>
<p>After that we left the café.  I tried to beg off her invitation, saying that the train was leaving in two hours, but she insisted I keep my word.  I must have a bite of supper with them.  Everyone is waiting.</p>
<p>“And you must take nice things back for Misha – Mother has prepared them – you cannot disappoint them.”
So we went home.</p>
<p>Once again I sat at the table, being served by all.  The table was set in a festive way, and laden with special holiday food.  A few family friends arrived – a groom and his bride – and a young man with his wife.  They all turned to me and sent special greetings to Misha.</p>
<p>The talk concerned education.  The bride scolded the groom for not allowing her to go into town to take courses.  The groom answered that he did not require an educated wife, he simply didn’t believe in such a thing.  He worked in a timber logging company as an overseer, and wore shiny high boots and a small hat that covered his eyes.</p>
<p>The ‘Fraulein’ Bella sat next to me .  She was quiet and thoughtful, and let out a sigh every so often.<br>“She sighs, poor thing,” agreed the mother, “She would also like to get away to town and see Misha.  Am I right my daughter?”</p>
<p>The daughter did not respond.  She only gazed at me with a playful look. Soon the mother turned to me : “Do you really want to leave tonight?  If you don’t feel like going, you could stay here with us, sleeping here is not a problem.”</p>
<p>I was somewhat embarrassed by their openness.  “No, thank you, it has already been decided.  I am leaving today!”
“We shall soon see”, Bella’s voice suddenly rang out.  She gave me a long, deep look from under her shaded eyebrows.</p>
<p>It was becoming late, but increasingly difficult to interrupt the pleasant proceedings around the table.  I soon agreed to remain in the house overnight, though I did not really want to do this.  The feeling that I was really a complete stranger, an unfamiliar person plagued me, as if I had stolen something.</p>
<p>After the enjoyable supper, I began to tire, with a pleasant weariness which led me to a comfortable sofa nearby.
“Well, it is time,” I said slowly and drawing out my watch, added, “I have only fifteen minutes left.”
“You will not make it!” Bella exclaimed, and was suddenly happy.
“If it is not terribly important to you,” added the father, “Why must you hurry?  Perhaps it is best to leave tomorrow?”
“Tomorrow, tomorrow,” they all shouted, and the young man wearing the shiny boots even slapped me heartily on the shoulder.  “Stay here with us, and we’ll talk some more.”</p>
<p>The minutes flew by, and I was happy to stay, rather than hurry off to catch the train.
As I looked around the table, it became clear they were delighted that I had stayed.
The conversation began anew and the atmosphere became once again festive.  The groom began telling anecdotes that he had written down in a notebook.  After each joke, the bride would exclaim:  “Oh, is he a wicked one!”</p>
<p>Bella was sitting next to me, and each time I looked, she returned my gaze with a glittering fire in her eyes.  Even more than the first time, I felt drawn to her.  I saw the guests taking leave, as in a fog.  The father remained sitting at the table, absorbed in a book. The mother and the servant were bustling around, busily preparing a bed in the next room.  I sat with Bella, and we mumbled in half-words:</p>
<p>“You really aren’t ready for bed, are you?” It was not a question.
“No”, I answered. “I could sit here until daylight, it’s so peaceful and relaxing.”
“Well then, I am happy,” she lit up.  She stretched her hands high in the air, accenting her lovely, slim girlish figure.
“Papa, why must you strain your eyes?  Go on, lie down.”
The father slowly got up.  “Ah well, a good night…” </p>
<p> And he disappeared into the next room.  We sat on the sofa in silence.  We remained like this for a long time, as though expecting something.  Bella softly sang a Russian love song.  She seemed to be lonely.  It became even quieter, only the mother’s soft footsteps were heard as she hovered over the counters and drawers, like a large attentive house-bird.  She suddenly appeared saying:  “Well, your bedroom is ready.  Daughter, would you like to remain talking for a while?”</p>
<p>And she went off. </p>
<p>Bella arose and opened the shutters, and suddenly  greenish delicate moonlight poured into the room.
“Ah how beautiful!” Bella cried and extinguished the lamp.
The entire room was flooded with a wondrous blue-green light.  She opened the window, and a cool, fragrant stream of air filled the room.  We both stood next to the window, our heads held high to the dark sky above.</p>
<p>All at once she said, “Come, let’s go out on the verandah, it’s so lovely….”
She led me through a small entrance hall into a bower with glass walls, through which the moon shone in from all sides.  She sat me down on an old leather sofa, while she, bathed in blue moonlight, sat down beside me.</p>
<p>“Lie down, you will be more comfortable.” she said, wrapping her arms around her upheld knees.
“On nights like these one can go mad….”
“Yes….it is beautiful,” I answered.
“When Misha was here the last time, we also had such lovely nights.”</p>
<p>I remained silent.</p>
<p>“He didn’t even tell you?  He says that I am too poetic, perhaps, on nights like these I feel so sad.  Tell me, do you like Misha?”
“Yes, he is a gentle person,” I answered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Well then, I love you for that,” and she suddenly pressed my hand. “Let us both love him!” she said in a weary tone.  “Ah, please forgive me, I am such a wild one,..” and she hid her face in her bosom.</p>
<p>I lifted my head above her thick soft, cool hair which breathed of fresh dew, and without thinking ran my hand gently over her head.
She shuddered and cast a deep, sharp look at me, saying:  “Let us talk about Misha…”
I did not answer.</p>
<p>“Do you know how we met?  At friends, we were discussing….he spoke so cleverly, which pleased me .  But why are you so quiet?  Perhaps you would like to go to sleep?”
“No.”
“So what is the matter?  Are you angry with me?”
“No, why should I be?” I smiled faintly and continued to stroke her hair.  She displayed an indifferent manner, as if not noticing, and quickly resumed:  </p>
<p>“Oh, how we quarreled at the beginning!  I never agreed with him…do you hear?
He would always call me a ‘fantasizer’and I would call him an ‘exacter’…do you remember?  At Lermantov’s place? Ha, ha ha!
So,so…say something already!  I hate when you are silent.  All men love to keep quiet…don’t look at me like that….”</p>
<p>She placed her cool fragrant hand over my eyes.  My hand rested lightly on her full round shoulder.
The silence continued for a long time.  I lay with closed eyes, feeling the silky cool smoothness of her limbs.</p>
<p>The night dreamed on in silvery blue, and gentle sounds were heard over the sleeping world.  My eyes closed and I seemed to have lost track of time – I had no idea of how long – an hour, several hours, or minutes, until I heard her voice:</p>
<p>“Look  at us, we wanted to talk…tell me something interesting…”
But her eyes were distant and closed.
*
She looked like a small, lost, child now as she lay asleep in my embrace.  Her head was wildly thrown to the side, and the strips of light moved over her closed eyes, nose and lips.  I felt breath coming from her fresh mouth, and I imagined that devils had
tricked us into this weird light twixt heaven and earth.  Several times a tremor upset us, and then returned us once more to a sweet dream.</p>
<p>I could not fathom, in my tiredness, the beginning thread of what had brought me here; yet the name ‘Misha” seemed to pierce my skin.
I buried my head in her soft arms and thought of the great luck and joy that lay along a person’s road.  I felt the fading of night, and already regretted the separation of our two wildly beating hearts, of her blind, dreamlike behavior, which held her fast to me.</p>
<p>Thus, the daylight finally roused us, like two drunkards.  She led me to my bedroom
and, placing a long, lusty kiss on my mouth, vanished.</p>
<p>The sun soon forced its way through the closed shutters.  I slept briefly but soundly, and opened my eyes to a bright sunny spring day.  I lay awake, eyes open, and waited.</p>
<p>The last night stretched before me, like a lovely, familiar painting.  I recalled the scent of night dew on her soft skin, which set off a trembling in my heart.  I had no idea what time it was and, searching for my watch, I realized that I lay half-dressed.</p>
<p>At that moment the soft heavy steps of the barefoot servant were heard.  She knocked at the door, and opened it saying:  “The ‘barishnye’ asks whether the gentleman is up…”</p>
<p>It was early and I could have caught the morning train.  In a few minutes I was dressed and in the dining room.  At the table were the mother and father.  We drank tea, but ‘Fraulein’ Bella was not there.  I had time to wish my hosts a thankful farewell.</p>
<p>“This small package is for Misha,” the mother said.  It was a cake wrapped in white linen.
“You will tell him that the cake is not so great…however!  But where is Bella?”</p>
<p>At that moment Bella appeared on the threshold wearing a light coat, and a large white hat.  A faint blush colored her face as she looked at me.
“Papa, I will accompany our guest a little way.”</p>
<p>We left the house.  The servant was already waiting with a carriage.  We sat down inside and the horse began moving along.  We remained silent.  Only when we had come to the end of the street, she suddenly exclaimed:  “The package! The package for Misha!”
We turned around.  Again I saw the fine house with the green shutters.  The white linen package rested on my knee.  We made our farewell silently, without words…only with long, sad looks that held promise.  I wanted to say something, but no suitable word could capture the magical blue of that night.  </p>
<p>I placed the white package above my head in the train, and slept dreamily throughout the entire return trip.  Only when the train stopped at the station did I realize that I had no idea where Misha lived.  </p>
<p>The linen-wrapped cake – the gift for Misha – given in return for my very personal regards - remained untouched in my house for a long time.</p>
