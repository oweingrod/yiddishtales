<p class="dialogue">“Once again…your mother’s oldest brother was called Yossel, the younger one was called Mayshel, and the third?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“The third was a step-brother from the first husband.  The first husband was called Khayim, a tall Yid.  He had the large paper shop in the market – in the very center of the market!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Well, that I really can’t remember…I was just a child then, but Uncle Yossel, I do remember.  I recall he was a tobacco dealer, perhaps snuff also.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Ah, there were two brothers who handled tobacco, my uncles from my father’s side;
so, I think you are mistaken.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What do you mean – I’m mistaken?  I didn’t know Yossel the tobacconist? A yellowish Yid with a beard, the color of tobacco.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Yes, yes…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“So what are you saying, that I don’t remember? He was my mother Elye-Shloime’s
brother!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“No, no that was my father’s brother, who was my aunt’s second husband. Her 
first husband was Yehoshua, he was actually a Sarver.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Well, now I am really confused,  excuse me, but you don’t know what you’re talking about. Yehoshua Sarver was my friend, you understand.  How could I not remember Yehoshua Sarver?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“How could you possibly know him, since at that time I was a young boy, and he was
at least sixty?  I myself can barely remember him!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“So, if you have such a head - who is to blame?  I myself, as you see, can remember everything, as if it were happening now.   I remember that when your brother Isaac 
married Reb Shloime’s daughter from Lublin, they gave out fresh rolls to everyone on the street!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“My brother, Isaac? I never had a brother Isaac!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“You certainly had a brother Isaac! Wait a moment…what was his business? Yes, 
he was in leather. He had a leather shop.’</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Leather? None of us ever dealt in leather. We all dealt with oil or kerosene.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Wait, I know who you mean….you mean the Isaac who dealt with iron, he traded in iron! He lived on the same street as we did, but oy! He had a tragic death!
He choked on a bone in the middle of a Friday night meal! Vay, vay, the whole town mourned him!’</p>
<p class="dialogue">“So what you’re saying is no?  Alright then…no is no. Perhaps it doesn’t suit you
to tell me who you are?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What do you mean; I don’t want to tell you?  What do you mean?
I tell you that I am from the Tenenboims….and your family was well known to us.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“I recall, as if it were only yesterday, how I would come into your father’s shop – may he rest in peace - for a bottle of wine, for Shabbat or Yom Tov. He loved to recite from the good books; he always had a good word."</p>
<p class="dialogue">“How could you possibly have come to my father for wine? My father had no 
wine. My father-in-law sold wine. It was about half a year after the wedding, when the dowry was finally given. How did you get to my father and wine, when his whole life he sold lime and whitewash?"</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What do you mean?  That wine is dirtier, God forbid, than lime?
Secondly, what does it matter what a Jew deals in, at least it’s a living! But even worse, it simply doesn’t suit a man of your years to weave such a story!
Wait, I will soon remind you…sha..sha...Your mother was a tall woman, a nice-looking woman, good as gold, such a sweet soul…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Yes, yes, that is true.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And she certainly was called Dobele?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Certainly not!  My mother - may she rest in peace – was Miryam…yes, that’s what she was called…Miryam.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Akh…enough  already. You will soon tell me that her father, your grandfather, was not called Reb Aharon,  and did not deal in glass…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Certainly not!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Then you are, you’ll excuse me for saying, an old fool!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And you are a cow!”</p>
<hr>
<p>Both old people sat on a long wooden bench, like children, in the dried-out, thinning garden of the moshav zkaynim – the old folks’ home - with small, clenched, angry looks on their dried-apricot faces, warily eyeing each other.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“It is impossible to speak with you…your head is all muddled…you have forgotten everything!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And you are going to tell me what MY mother - may she rest in peace - was called?? Who ever heard of such a thing?!”</p>
<p>After a long silence, one turns to the other:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“How old are you?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What is it to you?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Are you afraid to tell me?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“I am old….let me see….around sixty-eight…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“The same as me!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Nu, so you see?  You should be able to remember!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“I actually do remember…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Sha, wait a moment….I will ask you something that you surely must know:<br>What was the old Rebbe called?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What was the old Rebbe’s name?  Who doesn’t know?  Rev Zeinvele!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Reb Zeinvele, he says.  Oy, this Jew is indeed crazy!  Listen to me, and don’t take this to heart…but I am beginning to think that you are not even from Radomer…”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Who says I am from Radomer?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What! You are not from Radomer?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Certainly not!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“So why are you going around telling me tales?”</p>
<p>And with that, the two old people angrily turned their backs on one another.</p>
