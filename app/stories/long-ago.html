<p>They both sat in the late afternoon, at a corner table of the restaurant.   It was quiet, and the attentive waiter, with silent steps, served them.</p>
<p>At the buffet, the cashier sat dreaming, but through the slits of his half-closed eyes, he watched the two guests speaking together with wide exaggerated movements, and loud, rasping voices.</p>
<p>He knew them well, from the old days, when they were both grand, handsome gentlemen with shining smooth faces, colorful clothes, brilliant signet rings sparkling on their fingers. They were the “Libling” actors from the Yiddish playhouse down the street.
From all the Jewish neighborhoods, and all the Jewish houses were heard their well-known ‘morality’ songs that  they sang on the stage.</p>
<p>He looked over at the two old ones, with their creased faces like two old dogs.</p>
<p>One of them, the taller one, lay with one hand on the table, the other holding a half-empty mug of beer; he picked up his absent-minded, bald head, while the other raised his lightly glazed eyes and began reminiscing:</p>
<p>“Yes, my friend, our heydays are over! …New times, new songs!  Ernesto, remember when I had my guest roles in Odessa??  Ah, brother!  When I appeared in the operetta…ah, what was it called?  When I played the Grand Inquisitor with my dear wife, Shayndele – of blessed memory - and we sang the duet together, and she reached for the high notes with such a squeak…and I said to her, on the stage: ‘Cow, shut your squeaker!’…upon which she gave me a pinch and let out a curse!  My friend, do you remember how she swore?  Ah brother, did she know how to curse!  And now she lies without a gravestone, a pain in my heart!”</p>
<p>“Yes friend….the good days are over,” the second replies with a bang on the table.
 “Yes, I remember your dear wife…..but do YOU remember my heroic roles?  When I played the Russian Consul in Istanbul?  When I came out on the stage with my glorious, heroic figure, with the white fur cape and high yellow boots, with the golden medallions?
Ah, brother, do you remember when I uttered: “Oh, Rakhke, bring me my heart’s desire – my beloved!”! Do you recall the storm this created in the theater…the thunderous applause?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. And do you remember, my friend, in the second act of “The Woman Hunter”,  when I shrieked: ‘A false serpent, a crocodile!’ and then I murdered the deceitful woman. Do you know, brother, when I stepped off the stage, the finest and loveliest ladies of the province awaited me…and one of the most beautiful threw herself in my arms and whispered that we should go to a hotel together…oh, friend, what a wondrous beauty she was!”</p>
<p>“And the one…who shot herself because of me - did you know her?”
“Yes, I think I did…wasn’t she a banker’s daughter?”
“Yes, brother, a banker…a millionaire…”</p>
<p>“And my Louisa, the one from Berditchev, who was so deeply in love with me that she ran away from under the wedding canopy…akh, what a scandal!!
I think I was playing “Bar Kokhba” at that time.  This was not long after my heyday with Shayndele, when she was still the prima donna.  Oh my friend, when I remember my dear wife…this calls for another <em>shnapps</em>” (whiskey)</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Waiter, a bigger one - with peppermint this time.”</p>
<p>The cashier opened one eye, stood up, and asked the waiter: “So, how does it stand?”
The waiter quietly went to their table, removed a piece of paper, and called out a number.
“Enough!” said the cashier, and the waiter with quiet steps approached the table and stood silently.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Where is the shnapps?” the actor asks.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“That’s it for tonight”, said the waiter quietly, closing his tired eyes.</p>
<p>
Both old actors bowed their heads and remained silent for a long time.  The waiter disappeared into a corner.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Brother,” the taller one said in a leisurely tone “will our time ever come back again?  Will we ever step onto the stage again in our heroic roles, with the golden medals, eh??  Will we once again show those old provincials …, ah, the devil take them!!!
Speak! Rudolf, Rudolfo, Yerukham, Yerukhmiel ‘Beigel-baker’! Are you sleeping??”</p>
<p>But the other heroic tenor was already snoring away, sleeping the troubled sleep of the done-in, the done-for, the sleep of the elderly, the  sleep of ‘do-you-remember?’, the sleep of the long ago.</p>
