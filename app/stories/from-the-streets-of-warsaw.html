<p>The “Frantsishkaner and Nalevkes”  corner is a station for most of the Jewish <i>drozshkes</i>— the horse and buggy carriages—and their drivers.  During the noisy daytime, one never hears or even takes note of their faces, as if they weren’t people, didn’t exist. But in the late evening when the neighborhood reveals shadows of old clothes, figures full of patches and tatters, only then are they seen. Suddenly the long row of buggies line up in a twinkle; their drivers crawl down from their coach seats, and stand round in a circle, conversing while leaning against their buggies.  Their thick hoarse voices tear through the night, and in their fur wrapped shoulders and legs, they look like strange dark creatures of the night.</p>
<p>The leader of the discussion is Hillel Drozshkes, with his yellowish straight tough beard.  He has spent forty years on the coach seats of the “Nalevkes”.
He always knows where there is a wedding or a funeral. And after he seats four ample women in his carriage, who are wailing and shaking on the way to the cemetery he has plenty of stories to tell.  For a wedding too, he cleverly knows how to ‘catch’ the in-laws or the rich uncles. He takes them right to the door with a “Mazel tov, relatives”, and earns an extra <i>zlote</i> – tip.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hillel yawns loudly and complains:  “Oy! Oy  brothers! Once we had a life in Warsaw…a tenner could buy you a <i>shnaps</i> (whiskey), and at two o’clock at night they would bring hot sausages and warm bagel right here to the circle – at two cents a piece. Today brother, you go into a bar, put down two zlote and they pour you a thimbleful of valerian liquid, which they call ‘liquor’, and for ‘dessert’…a <i>krenk</i> ( a sickness)... may the Devil take them…”</p>
<p>Another yawns loud and long: </p>
<p class="dialogue"> “Akh… akh...akh…we should all live so long. I myself am going to Palestina.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And what will you do in Palestina?”  asks Hillel. “There you’ll stand a
whole night and a day and not catch a customer.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“So you think, my dear brother, that it is a village there?  Ha?  Our Jews there have already put up a few cities and streets.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“But there they only ride on donkeys.”
This is followed by raucous rollicking laughter.</p>
<p>“Oh, come now, that was long ago.  Today, when I appear with my ‘stallion’, I swear I will make a living there.”</p>
<p>And so they stand around in the reflection of the wet streets, which are quiet and empty.  The cold electric lights skip around the wildly painted signs of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The drivers crawl up to the seats of their buggies and sleepily exchange
a few words.  They grumble and try to nap.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a group of people come from the neighborhood: men and women, boisterous and lively.   The men with hats on at a rakish angle, lifting up their <i>yomtovdike</i>- (holiday) kaftans protectively from the muddy street.</p>
<p>The light slumber of the drivers stops abruptly, and the reins are quickly grasped in their hands.</p>
<p>A running to and fro ensues. </p>
<p class="dialouge">“Where to, sir?”   “Come this way,uncle.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“With me, with me, you always travel with me.”</p>
<p>Then Hillel Drozshkes roars out in a high voice to the whole circle:
<p class="dialogue">
“Mazel tov, fine relatives! sit here!”
He takes hold of a few people, leads them to the carriage, and rides off like a devil.</p>
<p>And as he goes deep into the crowded streets, he turns round, showing his yellowish straight beard, and shouts to the remaining drivers:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Hey, so take yourselves off to Palestina!” </p>
