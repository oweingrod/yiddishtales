    The <em>shidekh,</em> - the marriage - was arranged on a strange, gray day, alongside the open grave of the father.
</p>
<p>
    Over the various screams and wailing of the disheveled women, those quiet words fell. The dead man lay in white on the <em>mita</em> – the death bed - near
    the grave, which looked like a blackened rubble heap in the gray, muddy earth.
</p>
<p>
    The young man thought, as he stood by the open grave of her father, how the entire gray, sad world around him seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the
    words that he had just uttered to the girl. Living as a tenant in the same house, he had simply wanted to comfort the orphan, the pale girl, Blimtche, the
    dead landlord’s daughter.
</p>
<p>
    For many long months he had heard, through the wall, the moans of the sick man. As he went through the house to wash up in the kitchen, he would inquire
    politely about the man’s health. While washing himself at the pump, he would hear the old woman, the landlady’s endless complaints.
</p>
<p>
    She complained about the old man, who wouldn’t be long for this world
</p>
<p>
    “And what will be with the unhappy girl? The girl, goodness knows, is slowly burning down like a candle.” The old woman kept repeating this each time she
    met him.
</p>
<p>
    And he, lying in the cold dark back room of the house, unwillingly heard the dragging footsteps of the landlady going to and from the sick room, as well as
    the light, delicate steps of the daughter, who also attended to her sick father.
</p>
<p>
    He rarely had a chance to speak with the girl; each time he met her, he encountered her pale, frightened look. He thought that this look asked something of
    him, and he began to imagine that he was the only strong person in the house who could help.
</p>
<p>
    The final few days soon began. It all started in the middle of the night. He was awoken by a commotion accompanied by a soft sobbing near his door. He got
    up and out of bed with half-closed eyes and opened the door.
</p>
<p>
    A lamp cast a dim light onto the scene. The girl was half lying, half sitting on a bench. She was not completely dressed, and her bare feet were visible.
    She looked like a grown- up disheveled child. Her head was buried in her shoulders, which shook with her sobs. There, behind the wall, near the bed of the
    man, sat the landlady, wringing her hands.
</p>
<p>
    The tenant went over to the wall and saw the sharp, pointed nose of the sick man, his lowered eyelids and the wasted, yellow hands on the coverlet. He
    understood that the end was near.
</p>
<p>
    He stood there a while longer, looking at the weeping girl. Suddenly deciding to approach her, he placed his hand on her trembling shoulders.
    <br/>
    She did not lift her head; only shuddered at his touch. He began to stoke her back, and a hot wave of tenderness suddenly overtook him. Even though she did
    not look at him, he could feel her yielding.
</p>
<p>
    She cast her head down even further, burying herself within, the cries slowly becoming softer and heavier. He knelt down towards her and inhaled the scent
    of her wildly disarrayed hair. The strange light in the house, where death had already crept into the corners, made him feel somehow closer to her, a sort
    of unsettled nearness.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly, she jumped up from the stool, and stood upright beside him like a stone. Her pale, frightened face looked up into his own face. He did not know
    what to do. She had suddenly grown bigger, and he saw before him a woman. All at once, casting aside all thoughts, he embraced her. She quickly stepped
    back, but remained leaning against him, her head on his chest.
</p>
<p>
    The night seemed to go on forever, and in the house, where death had cut down the life of one, there was born a new, warm breath of life between the orphan
    Blimtche and the tenant from the back room.
</p>
<p>
    In the morning, the whole house seemed to have undergone a transformation. The threshold of his room suddenly seemed to disappear. He felt a close
    familiarity with all corners of the house – the cabinets, the beds. From every corner, he felt the warm breath of her skin. He did not go out to work,
    despite the fact that the long black bundle - the deceased - lay on the ground, straw sticking out from under the heavy hard head, the cloudy dim light of
    the two candles, all awoke in him a terrible urge to run away.
</p>
<p>
    With the coming of day however, relatives appeared - women in dark shawls draped over their heads, and men, heads sunken into their beards.
</p>
<p>
    A tired, depressing sense of death in their eyes.
</p>
<p>
    The house was full of people coming in and out, accompanied by the confusion that reigns over a house visited by the misfortune of death or the tragedy of
    fire. From time to time a wild cry of pain would ring out, as of teeth being pulled. This was the old lady or perhaps a relative, wanting to show her
    sympathy.
</p>
<p>
    Blimtche was led away to the back room, that of the tenant, in order to keep her far away from the dead man. All at once, the old landlady, face swollen
    with crying, dragged her feet over to him and in a voice full of tenderness, which he had never before heard, said:
</p>
<p>
    “Go to her …to Blimtche….I simply have no strength left…”
</p>
<p>
    He felt that the old woman knew everything, and when he went to see Blimtche in the half-darkened room, where a few other women sat, they all got up at
    once, and after shooting him long penetrating looks, left the room, so the two could be alone.
</p>
<p>
    When the funeral procession was on its way, he left the house, and seemed to see the street before him for the first time. He slowly breathed in the dull
    day’s humid air, and it seemed as though the fear of death, the irritating silence of the candles had all left him. There was no sun, yet the humid
    grayness of the day refreshed him. He suddenly felt distant from the funeral of this unknown Jew. He was pulled back into the world, away from the place
    where he stood, and suddenly felt the unexpected heaviness of Blimtche’s hand on his arm. She clung to him, with lowered head, her hair now covered in a
    black shawl. She pressed herself up against him, and he felt uncomfortable in the presence of the others.
</p>
<p>
    She cried softly and this reminded him of the night when she lay in his arms.
</p>
<p>
    He was engulfed by a powerful curiosity as to whether she too, was thinking of the same night. He pressed her arm to him and she responded to his touch.
</p>
<p>
    He continued keeping pace with the funeral procession, still not believing
</p>
<p>
    that what happened during the night was not a mere dream.
</p>
<p>
    He was totally unprepared for the events which then unfolded – when at the open grave, amidst the wailing and screams, he soon heard words spoken directly
    to him. The girl fainted in his arms. The old woman’s harsh, abusive words were heard. She spoke in strong and strident tones, almost screeching, like a
    mad prophetess. She complained bitterly to her husband, who had left her alone, alone in the great, big world.
</p>
<p>
    “…..And who will worry about me….a broken vessel….. a ship without a rudder….without a friend and without a breadwinner……? Who?” her voice seemed to echo
    eerily off the headstones.
</p>
<p>
    For a long time she went on like this, emptying herself with this outpouring of senseless talk, a crazed expression masking her pale face. Then suddenly
    she cried out:
</p>
<p>
    “Daughter!” Her voice cut through the air, like a sharp knife, slashing violently across the entire cemetery. She then fell heavily upon her fainting
    daughter, embracing her and, at the same time, falling upon him, as he nearly toppled over under their combined weight.
</p>
<p>
    “Daughter,” she cried out. “You will be helped by God….you are an orphan and God is a father to orphans. My good people,” she called out to the mourners,
    sweeping them all with her jittering eyes, “he even lived to see her betrothed, which God sent to her.” There was a strange hush, as she went on:
    “Daughter, ask your father to intercede on your behalf, and to bless you”.
</p>
<p>
    Her last words shocked the other mourners …there was much murmuring and noise.
</p>
<p>
    The girl remained in the arms of the tenant, and when the grave-diggers, moaning with effort, slowly lowered the body into the grave, a few of the Jews
    encircled the young man in a mildly pressing manner - he felt that they wanted something from him, but could not understand what. They spoke strongly to
    him, in warning tones, grabbed his right hand and firmly placed it into the hand of the fainting Blimtche. And then, one of the men, a Jew with closed eyes
    and a small white beard, began swaying and jumping up and down, mumbling as though in prayer, and suddenly shouted:
</p>
<p>
    “<em>Mazel tov</em>! <em>Mazel Tov</em>!”
</p>

</p>
<p>
    A sharp, piercing pain engulfed him from head to toe. His ears began to ring and then became oddly deaf. He could only hear the dull, dry clatter of the
    clods of earth, as they crumbled and fell.
</p>
<p>
    Still deaf and dumb to everything around him, he returned home, accompanied by strange, swirling imaginings that he now shared something with the stiff
    corpse, which they had covered over with earth. He stretched out on his bed, closed his eyes, and tried to quell the storm of thoughts and emotions forcing
    their way into head and heart.
</p>
<p>
    Then he heard Blimtche’s gentle footsteps. She entered his room barefoot, with soft, quiet steps, and tenderly caressed his hair, bending down to place a
    cool, comfortable pillow beneath his aching head…..
