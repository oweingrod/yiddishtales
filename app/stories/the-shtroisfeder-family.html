<p>THE SHTROISFEDER FAMILY
        DI  SHTROISFEDERS
E.  Kaganovski</p>
<p>In the Shtroisfeder’s house, all three large and dusky rooms were full of old, depressing furniture, which gave off a sickly sweet smell of dead wood.  Yet, once again, preparations were being made for a zekhts – a meeting of a ‘look/see’ matrimonial nature.</p>
<p>As always, whenever a new prospective bridegroom comes to look over Panne (Miss) Bronye, the old closed-up house comes to life, as though suddenly roused  from a long and sound sleep.  The old, sedately genteel household suddenly shines with renewed splendor, the rickety, creaking furniture showing off its ability to once more gleam and glisten.     </p>
<p>The pictures on the wall – Jews with beards and German yarmulkes, resplendent with curled whiskers….Uncle Hendrik and the pompous Mauritz;  the beauty, Paulina, with her long locks curled round her head - all look down from the wall, cautiously safeguarding the Shtroisfeder’s household.</p>
<p>On the ancient heavy sideboard, which stands like a lonely defiant fortress, the crystal glassware shimmers, sparkling with the pride of bygone simkhes (festivities).  One can almost detect the scent of weddings, divorces, and yes, even death.</p>
<p>Marianna, the old faithful servant, runs from corner to corner, filling the house with a special, meaningful bustle.  She has known many days like these, when a hopefully destined bridegroom arrives for the thirty-eight year old Panne Bronye.  Her full, warm-hearted breast begins beating with the sadly familiar remembered hopes of her own unfulfilled matchmaking arrangements.  She looks upon Bronye, tenderness reflected in her small green eyes, a glance that speaks of hidden dreams and love.  Her tiny round face blossoms into a rosy flush, like a ripe watermelon, as  she watches Bronye, who sits and peels on her new, shiny silk stockings over her full, mature and heavy legs.  This gives Marianna a sense of hidden pleasure.   </p>
<p>Bronye is quiet. On an old fashioned vanity table, she lays out some old, yellowed visiting cards from doctors and lawyers – some already deceased – and her cheeks flush a deep red.  Her billowing rounded bosom begins to heave, enflaming her face.  Marianna can no longer contain herself.  She remains standing next to Panne Bronye, her heavy bare arms at her sides. Bronye tries to hide her stomach and appear girlish.  Then she suddenly grabs Marianna round her warm, wide waist, and the maid bursts forth in a hoarse, pious-like voice:</p>
<p>“Bronyushka…..there will be a wedding….I had a dream...it will be!”
Bronye is annoyed: “Let me be.  A  guest will be coming….and all you think of is this..!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the afternoon  dusk settles over the house.  In the furthest room on the bed lies old Shtroisfeder.  His small white beard circles his thin yellow lined face, looking almost like an etrog (ceremonial Succoth lemon) lying on a bed of cotton wool.  A small gray cap is perched on his head and, resting next to him, his only friend – the short thick wooden cane, with its rubber foot – which accompanies his shuffling, gout-ridden steps.  He dreams of his meager dietetic meal. His mind also wanders to the deep darkness of the iron chest in the room, where lie hidden the hopes of a dowry: papers with scribbled figures, and a small, secret case containing still smaller caskets of brooches, rings and pearls that once belonged to her – his wife.</p>
<p>When she died, she wanted to speak of these, but he had already understood for whom they were destined.  And each time, when Madame Zaks, with her tiny shadowy steps appears to propose a match, he is once again filled with a longing for his wife.  She left him alone in these old rustling rooms, with his cold feet and the warm secrets of bygone years, reflected in the sparkle of her jewelry in the iron chest.</p>
<p>A gray haunting cloud, like a hazy fog, circles round his dream-filled mind.
Old days appeared as though sprinkled with the radiance from another world.  Old Shtroisfeder swims around in the depths of those vanished years.</p>
<p>A heavy dream of forty-three years; he can almost smell the faint scent of long-gone people.  He sees his wife, Dora, in her complete and mighty demeanor, her look of haughty pride, and the queenly manner in which she reigned over the house.  He hears the family arguments with in-laws and relatives, the echo of his wife’s strong voice.  Then she rises once more, from under the heavy headstone of the grave, where she lies in the silent field, with the name Shtroisfeder written in Polish.  There he, too, will rest, there is no other way.  And he is suddenly encircled by the black, frightening arms of the Jewish grave diggers, who carry in their beards the dark words of death.  He is sure that they know him and are waiting for him with the lure of the next world.  He feels feeble, and succumbs to the weakness that suddenly overcomes him.  He hears the echoes of his dead, swollen feet as they carry him higher over his body, and the fear of his last hour fills his chaotic mind.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p> These hours of remembering occur almost every day after the mid-day meal, after the few noisy businessmen leave the house.  Then the old Shtroisfeder sneaks away, with broken footsteps, leaning heavily on his cane, to the darkened bedroom full of angry ghosts.</p>
<p>Bronyeslova gently tapped on the door of his bedroom, interrupting the old one’s sleep.
“Tatenyu…”
The floor, shiny with age, creaked and shivered under the heavy weight of her steps:
“Tatenyu…”
“Good….good that you woke me up, daughter…I wasn’t sleeping…only these dreams that befuddle….”</p>
<p>The old man stretched out his hand toward the cane, and his daughter helped him to sit up.  He remained sitting, leaning hard upon his cane, as if it were a park bench.  His robe hung forward on his bony knees, as though on a fence.</p>
<p>They remained silent for a long while in the empty shadows of the room.
The iron chest, with its brass locks, like silent suppressed mouths, stands observing.   Bronye bent over her small father who, beside her, looked like a child.  She was tightly corseted around the waist, and with her every move, a slight rip was heard, as of silk tearing.  Finally she spoke, hiding her face:</p>
<p>“Tatenyu. Perhaps you would like to get changed…”</p>
<p>As she spoke she was reminded of the many times she had uttered this phrase to him.
“Well, yes, yes….” the old man answered with a sigh.</p>
<p>In the scant light of the window, he now looked himself over, from top to bottom.  He wanted to tell her about the dreams in his tired head.  He somehow wanted something of her, but he could not remember what it was.
He was sure that her broad, powerful hands could do something to tie him to the present living world, which was still hazy around him.  Taking her thick round hand into his own, he said:
“Tokhter, make peace with all….time does not stand still…it’s a different world today…it’s no use….if one is an ordinary person, all may yet be well. 
Madam Zaks tells me that he is a gentle, young man… it will work out….why should your life be sad and dismal? Try to get used to the idea.”</p>
<p>He suddenly added in a tense, hoarse voice:  “If only she were alive!”
He felt a warm dampness on his thin, dry, shaking fingers.
Bronye shivered slightly, and her heavy head remained resting on his hunched and bony shoulders.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It had not been so light and bright in all corners of the Shtroisfeder’s house – even in the neglected dusty rooms - for a very long time.  This was one of the last efforts to create a simkha (joy) in the house.  Everyone felt this, even the maid, Marianna, who alone served at table.  She fixed her small, green peasant eyes onto the young man, who arrived with an elderly, gray-whiskered gentleman.  The young man was seated opposite the old Shtroisfeder.</p>
<p>Marianna could not understand why they had brought such a small, weak and pale young man, whose hair already revealed a balding tendency.
She began to think of Bronye’s strong powerful limbs, and the contrast of such a couple made her heart beat with images of sweet intrigue.</p>
<p>The old man was half-sitting in his wide chair, and his small, pale hands encircled a sparkling glass of tea.  His head was thrown back, like in the good old days, when guests were present.  He spoke of the family, looking upwards, to the ceiling.  Today he talked of new and different times, of the many recent people who had worked themselves up into a fine livelihood.  The elderly man who accompanied the ‘bridegroom’ felt obliged as well to speak in a loud voice, which was not his usual custom.  His words sounded hollow, and seemed to come from behind a mask.  The other guests around the table had been quiet up to now.</p>
<p>In addition to the two married sisters, Balbina and Marta, who lived with their husbands in the distant streets of the town, there was also seated Herr Levi, a neighbor in the same courtyard who, for the past thirty years, was always present at any of the special occasions at the Shtroisfeders.  There were also two of Panne Bronye’s close friends, Stella, an older girl, and Karola who had divorced her husband six months after marrying.  Bronye sat next to them.  Her face was flushed and her eyes were half-closed, though she quietly conversed and laughed with the others, her mighty bosom heaving, while the chair beneath her creaked.</p>
<p>As usual, the older voices were the loudest.  They spoke of side issues, constantly raising new themes to discuss.  The ‘bridegroom’ himself did not allow his thin, squeaking voice to be heard.  His small, pink hands were on the table, lost in the large cuffs of his jacket. His dry, disorderly hair seemed clamped to his forehead, which was covered with pink, tissue-thin skin.</p>
<p>All at once, the older man who had come with the ‘bridegroom’ stood up. 
Rubbing his hands together, with a twinkling smile beneath his whiskers, he leaned forward as if in prayer and said:<br>“Well, gentlemen….we must begin to talk business….”</p>
<p>With that, the neighbor Levi stood up and leaned on the table, unsure of what to do.  At that point, the old Shtroisfeder, using his small, thin hand, began groping for his stick.  Bronye quickly rushed forward to help.  She placed the cane in his hand and told him to sit up.  Thus, the old man touched her fingers as though he wished to convey something to her.  She led him to the next room, and their eyes met.  His intense fiery look seemed to say that he was now about to engage in an important negotiation., and she must stand prepared. Bronye had seen this look more than once.  She closed her eyes and her lips quivered. </p>
<p>The old man stood still and beckoned to the young man’s companion.
“Please, we old people will have a discussion in the next room.  Join us, Levi”.  He turned to his neighbor, “This is my old friend…”
The ‘bridegroom’ also stood up, ready to go.  But his older companion turned to him, as to a child saying, “Stay here… enjoy a bit.”
The young man smiled wanly and sat down again.</p>
<p>It remained very quiet.  Both girlfriends were cracking nuts with a nutcracker.  One of the girls struggled to crack open a nut. Then the young man turned to her:
“Please, Miss, allow me….”
And all the women looked as his small, pink hands held the nutcracker.
He wanted to crack the nut quickly, but the nut would not yield. He squeezed his lips together, and closed his eyes tightly.  The thin veins on his forehead stood out like delicate threads.  But still the nut would not crack.  The older sister, Balbina’s voice was heard: 
“Never mind, it’s not important….”</p>
<p>The young man quickly looked round and saw, as if for the first time, the small group of large, red-faced women around him.  He glanced round, and like a bird, searched for a place to fly.  And with a lost look, he remained seated.</p>
<p>Bronye felt a rising hatred for her spoiled sister, who had a big, healthy husband with broad shoulders.  At that moment, she recalled dozens of wrongs and small acts of wickedness that her sisters had done to her.  More than anything, she wanted to redeem this small thin man, help him to rise high in their esteem, make him strong and secure.  Holding back the anger, which reddened her face and neck, she suddenly spoke out with a strange high-pitched voice, in Polish:  “Is the Herr born in Warsaw?”
“No”, answered the ‘bridegroom’ softly, “I was born in Lublin.”
“Ah, in the Lublin area…it is very nice there.”  Bronye continued slowly, afraid that the discussion might disappear, “There are many pleasant neighborhoods there.”
She was determined not to be ashamed of anyone and looked at him with a full and open gaze.
“Yes, it is very nice there,” the young man answered quietly, “though I left that place when I was still a boy.”  And suddenly, with a smooth and warm voice, added: “But every place, when one is young, is pleasant…”</p>
<p>Everyone looked around, as if wondering that the young man could actually speak.  Bronye triumphantly looked at all of them.  Her eyes were flooded with warmth:  “You are right, thank you,” she replied, hesitatingly.  The small, young man seemed to grow in her eyes.  She was determined not to stop the conversation, and frightened to be left alone in this house.  She felt that her old, worn-down father was in that darkened room planning something for her.  She would have liked to remain with this man and take fate into her own hands.  Her girlfriends, Stella and Karola, stared at her with a strange seriousness.  She wanted to show them that something could really happen to her, and so remarked further:
“Perhaps the Herr would like something more to drink?”
With this, she quickly removed the plate of nuts from the side of the table where the young man sat.</p>
<pre><code>                                                  *
</code></pre><p>The young man felt the warmth that suddenly surged towards him from Bronye, and now, as she bent over towards him, their eyes met for the first time.  He recognized in her brown, honest eyes a strong wave of emotion, of love.  He felt a strange flush of warmth and, gathering himself together as though he were about to lift a heavy weight, he felt himself growing taller, stronger.
He did not look at the two sisters, alternately engaged in secret whisperings, breaking out in fits of high, cackling laughter.  He began to talk about the house, which seemed so old to him.  Lifting his head, he saw a lofty ceiling, where shadows hid in the corners like dark birds.  Bronye was telling him how long they had lived there, how old the house was….while her thoughts kept ringing a silent alarm – something will come of this.  She was particularly happy to hear him talking about the house – that must mean he would be glad to remain.  The two chatterers lugged forth a family album, and began calling out various names.  Slowly, the album went from hand to hand until Bronye took it over and, sitting near the young man, began showing him the photos:</p>
<p>“This is the clever one…you must have heard of him…Dr. B.; he was very well known…”
She turned page after page, naming all of the family members.
“And this is….Mamenyu.”
It became quiet.  The young man looked at the tall, full figure of a woman with a swept-up hairdo.  He blinked his eyes, and finally said:
“A beauty of a woman. How long ago did she die?”
“It is now six years…”
The page remained open, until the sisters came to ask:
“Show us our mamushye.”
Bronye felt the need to ‘repay’ them and, pretending not to have heard, she closed the album pressing down on it with her elbow, hands over her eyes.
“Let us see mameshu,” the sisters cried out angrily, their large full mouths twisting into twin grimaces.  At that very moment, Bronye jumped up and, calling the servant, began to tend to the guests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, squeaky footsteps were heard coming from the consultation room.
The elders were returning with a report.  They had to go through a long, poorly-lit corridor. 
*
When the old man returned to the dining room, Bronye came towards him to help.  He threw her a confused look, which revealed a slight smile.  At first, he thought this was his wife Dora, the two were so alike.  She seemed to fill up the whole house, and the old man felt a shimmer of the bygone holidays, when the house was full of all manner of family and abundance.
According to the hand-rubbing of the older guest and Mr. Levi, it seemed as if an agreement had been reached.  Once again, they all sat down at the table, and when Bronye went into the kitchen to arrange the evening meal, Marianna was already waiting with a red face and a mixture of sobs and laughter:<br>“Blessings, Panyenka, blessings….” she cried and threw herself onto Bronye.
Bronye pushed her lightly aside, busying herself with preparations.</p>
<p>Loud voices were heard round the table.  The older folks spoke of wine, the good old wines.  Bronye heard with a beating heart that the old man might finally ask for the hidden, fifty-year-old wine, which had never been opened.  Once the final arrangements were made, she might see the old man rush with agile steps to the iron chest.  There in the dark corner, the bottle glowed.</p>
<p>All at once, Bronye felt a sense of sadness, a pang of regret that no one had asked her if she were satisfied, happy, or whether the small, thin young man was truly her heart’s choice. She imagined her father had forgotten about her.  She rushed after him into the dim room, took him by the arm and suddenly felt that he had been waiting for this all along.  He held his head up high, stretched out his vein-covered neck, and kissed her forehead.  Her heart overflowed with unrestrained warmth.  She embraced his small head and began kissing him.
From the few graying hairs on his head, she felt the gentleness of a bygone childhood, and barely caught her father’s trembling words:
“What do you say, tokhter?”
“I don’t know tatenyu.  He looks gentle and…weak….”
The old father was silent for a moment, and then slowly said:
“The main thing is the person, the mentch, my daughter….I will not force you….you are no longer a child…you will get to know him.”</p>
<p>Then the old man, with shaking hands, took out the keys to the iron chest, and Bronye, with unusual agility, unlocked the lower shelf of the chest herself, and withdrew the old bottle of wine.
                                                       *
It had been many years since the dining room of the Shtroisfeders was so brightly lit - as though the old-fashioned dishes and glassware were celebrating a Yomtov. (holiday).  Shades of long-forgotten talk and arguments seemed to be heard from all corners of the large room. 
The doorbell rang, and the sister’s husband, Leon Shpigel, the dentist, was ushered in by the joyous sisters.  The arrival and greeting of her brother-in-law took a long time and was like a disturbing wind in the midst of the comfortable ambience that had preceded him.  The old Shtroisfeder, as well as his daughter, felt this intrusion and asked his son-in-law to sit down next to his wife. </p>
<p>After a few quiet moments, Leon turned to his wife:
“So… shall we leave soon?”
Right after this, the older companion stood up and said to the ‘bridegroom’:
“Well, for us it is also quite late!”
Mr. Levi also stood up to leave.  Suddenly Leon seemed to remember something and turned to the young man:
“Excuse me, but what is your family name?”
“Zamek….Pinkus Zamek…”
“Ah so, Mr. Zamek,” repeated the dentist to himself, and exchanged glances with his wife.  She burst out in a loud laugh, and blurted out “Zamek”.
Suddenly alarmed, she added: “A very nice name.”</p>
<p>Soon the guests took leave of one another.  The old Shtroisfeder was tired, but regardless, he accompanied each of them to the door.  The minute the door closed behind them, Panne Bronye disappeared from the dining room.  She went into the darkened room and threw herself face down, on the cold, worn-out couch.  Her feet hung down. Her eyes were tightly closed, as though trying to chase away uncomfortable feelings.</p>
<p>In the dark, she was able to see more clearly everything that had occurred that evening.  She saw the young man, Zamek, with his sparse teeth and his thin, rosy lips as he ate.  She saw once again his pale eyes, which looked at her with such fright, and his thin, delicate pink hands.</p>
<p>She knew that she must now be with her father, who would certainly be lying sleepless in his large, old bed, thinking of what this evening would bring.  But it was difficult for her to leave this darkness and the heaviness of her body.  She remembered her sisters, who had so playfully greeted her brother-in-law.  She now heard their mischievous laughter, and wished they would finally leave.  </p>
<p>At that moment, she heard footsteps.  Her two girlfriends stepped into the darkness of the room.  They searched for her and found her on the sofa.  They did not speak to her, but found her face in the dark and kissed her, with a special tenderness.  They touched her cheeks with their fingers, looking for tears.  This suddenly released in her a deep and gentle sobbing.
Then she heard her sisters and brother-in-law, departing at last.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Bronye lay there for a long while.  She abandoned the stream of thought in her mind and began to imagine past days and years, stretching out like a long, infinite chain.  Rarely did any color appear in the endless gray.  She was grateful now to see everything so clearly, as if the secret of her life was finally being revealed.  She curled herself up tightly, trying with a mighty effort to use every bit of strength in her body to stop the endless gray line of her life. “Something must happen!!” she cried out with all her heart.  She searched for words, new words, about herself and all that was around her, words from which she had escaped all her life.  She thought of herself as old, and about how she wanted to have a man, a husband to talk with at night, to share her hidden thoughts.</p>
<p>She listened to the house.  From the furthest room shone a small lamp.  She hurried to hear the words she had so long awaited from her father.
She felt how the old man with his weak hands also sought the warmth of her joy.  Quietly she crept to his bedroom.  The door was ajar.  She came close to his bed, and heard with a regretful sigh, her father’s light snoring.  The lamp with its golden glow had softened the deadly white pallor of his head, as it lay hard and heavy on the pillow. His lower lip drooped, revealing yellowed gums and thin, white false teeth. </p>
<p> And Panne Bronye felt that she was alone.</p>
