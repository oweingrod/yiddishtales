<p>Grandmother Breindl had long since forgotten her age. Yet, if anyone should claim that she was older than her eighty years, she would get angry and say: </p>
<p class="dialogue">
“What have you suddenly seen in me?…Why are you counting the years?…I don’t need anyone to add years to my life…and to defy those enemies, I will continue to live!” </p>
<p> 
She sits on her bed in the corner, holding her cane in her thin, childish fingers as her small, gray head with half-glazed eyes shakes back and forth: 
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“No, No….such a <i>khutzpeh</i> (impertinence) to add years…If God wants me to live….so be it!”</p>
<p>The bobeshi – grandmother - lives in Praga in her wooden house, which she hasn’t left for the last fifteen years.  Forty years ago, the bobeshi was the greatest merchant in Praga.  She had a perfume business, several houses, and horses. Her husband, Mendel Prager, would receive the finest rabbis of the Polish Empire.</p>
<p>She had sixteen children – nine sons and seven daughters. Two of the daughters died, and one son went insane, but no one remembers them any more.  In addition, the remaining children  all live in Warsaw now, in the area of Tvarde and Zshelozne, where their business ventures were established – in foodstuffs, oil, coal and kosher wine for the Sabbath and havdoleh - the ceremony ending the Sabbath.</p>
<p>The bobeshi had long since forgotten how many children her sons and daughters had; what their names were and what they looked like.</p>
<p>Years ago, when she would sit in her old armchair, the house would be flooded with <i>mishpokhe</i> (family) - on the eve of Yom Kippur, when they would all come to be blessed by the bobeshi. From Sabbath to Sabbath there would be long lines of grandchildren, boys and girls, bigger ones and smaller ones: dark-haired and fair-haired boys, in long kaftans with side curls. The line took up half the bridge over the river. They would come to Bobbe Breindl for Shabbes-ovent – Shabbat evening. The bobeshi would ask each one his name, what he had learned, and then hand out candies, honey cake and apples.</p>
<p>However, since the war, old Breindl had lost all contact with Warsaw. She now seldom saw any of her sons, unless one came to tell her tales of woe.  She could barely understand his bitter complaints or what he described. She only remembered a bridge, that led to a city with streets and gardens, where angry Cossacks wandered. The war, with the shooting and upheaval that reached her - the dark, restless sounds - reminded her of a pogrom, which she had witnessed, sometime in the distant past, when she had been but a small and simple girl.</p>
<p>She heard, somehow, of a grandson – Shloime – whom she barely remembered, who had been captured in the war with the Germans. For many long nights, she thought of him in goyishe hent (among the gentiles) - being held somewhere. Then she began to hear more of the Germans. She even began to see the restless, turbulent street through the windows of her house, but she could not begin to fathom what it was all about.</p>
<p>The grandchildren never came anymore, and her sons – only rarely. Older men, all strange, depressed Jews, would come and call her mame (mother). She became weaker, and her whole life began to pass before her eyes – her dead husband, Mendl, people from the old days, events from her youth – began to fill the corners of the house, which still belonged to her.</p>
<p>Her mind began to wander further, ever further, and she could no longer clearly recall when the children had sold the house. She was kept alive now only because of the glazier’s wife; the old woman brought her warm meals, for which she was paid weekly, by the Prager Rabbi.</p>
<p>And so she lay, with half-closed, dreaming eyes, and her frail mind would faintly recall sounds and sights from years ago. Once, she saw herself being brought to the <i>khupe</i> (the marriage canopy).  Another time, she saw the Gerer Rabbi coming — there was a <i>simkhe</i>, (a celebration) and she must prepare the table for the Hasidim…then she imagined seeing her mad son, Yeshaye, shivering with cold, half-naked in the street…and suddenly she heard the sweet singing of prayers, as though angels were singing.</p>
<p>She then began to hear the voice of her husband, Mendl Prager, telling her about the next world and the Holy Torah.  At times she heard wagons, heavily laden wagons, full of wares… bringing goods…</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“Merchants are coming, she thought, “rich merchants…speaking in high and mighty tones.”</p>  <p>She continues in a brief moment of clarity - and her eyes close once more, embracing the next sweet dream.</p>
<hr>
<p>Today no one comes. Breindel is left in her bed, in a small corner of her small room. In her old room live new neighbors who have agreed to wait and suffer until the old one dies. Neighbors and old Prager householders, who remember Breindel the businesswoman, approach her bed with a nod:
 “How are you?”</p>
<p>
And as they leave, one places an orange; another, a fresh bun, by her bedside. These are from other merchant women who ‘collect’ a <i>mitzve</i> (a good deed), in a hurry.</p>
<p>But her corner is quiet. One can barely discern the small, shrunken body of the old one. She sleeps, for hours at a time, unaware of the noise of other people in the house. From time to time, she opens her eyes, mumbles something and complains to her old friend, the glazier’s wife who can also barely stand on her own two feet these days.</p>
<p>She recounts her dreams in a thin, reedy voice; bids the glazier’s wife to take out her <i>takhrikhim</i> (burial shrouds) funeral clothes - which lay in a small basket; and with a weak smile says:
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
“See?  Where would you find such a fine weave today?…Like silk…it shines in your eyes…”</p>
<p>And when evening falls, the old one begins to do battle with her various devils. The women of the yard know precisely when it is time to gather round the bed with fearful, frightened laughter and grimacing mouths. The old one is given a cane, and the war begins: </p>
<p class="dialogue">“You old ‘freemason’….you old devil….you think you can touch me?.Shma Yisroel…(Hear O Israel)...Oy Vey…He is pulling at me…you devil, you…”</p>
<p>The old one pokes the air with her stick. She wants to escape the devils, who tease and torment her, as they dance around, trying to snatch away her blankets. She especially tries to avoid one particular old devil – he pesters her with ugly tricks, dances and bares his teeth. </p>
<p>
The battle with the devils takes a long time. The house fills with men and women. One man quickly takes up the prayer book, <i>T’hilim</i> (Book of  Psalms) - and reads, while the women lament:</p>

<p class="dialogue">An old person is like a child…God ridicules a person!”</p>

<hr>
<p>Meanwhile, the old glazier’s wife puts on her best Sabbath clothes and sets out for the Gzshibov district. She starts out in the morning and walks for several hours, resting every few minutes. And when she arrives in the areas of Tvarde and Gzshibov, she enters the stores and homes of the various sons and daughters.</p>
<p>Men and women, shop owners with heavy beards of black, blond and red look at her and, finally recognizing her, become silent, nod and speaking in hushed tones, ask: “Where does it stand now?...”</p>
<p class="dialogue">The glazier’s wife speaks sadly and quietly to each one: “The old one is on her way”. </p>
<p>
The sons and their wives put on their Sabbath clothes. Stores are closed. Family members are told. The procession starts towards Praga. On the bridge, families who haven’t seen each other in years greet one another somberly.</p>
<p>They all come down to Praga, remembering the old days; and all at once the house is again filled with people. They stand in a ring around the bed; the old Jews bend over Breindl and cry out: “Mame”.</p>
<p>The old one is dreaming…she suddenly opens one eye, looks around at everyone, and dreams on.</p>
<p>And thus they sit, counting the hours, as they recite the Psalms, and wait out the night.</p>
