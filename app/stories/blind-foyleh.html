<p>The ‘street’ remembers Folyeh for more than 30 years - when he was a well-known dealer in poultry at the <i>holyes</i> – the town’s market place. He was a man of importance then and a rich man as well. He was considered a hero because of his great strength, and was called “Folyeh the Giant”. He could lift even the heaviest wagon up onto his shoulders! There wasn’t a single soul in or around the “Iron Gates” neighborhood, or the marketplace,  who did not know Folyeh.</p>

<p>Everyone still remembers how he would come home on leave during the time he served with the Grenadiers in Moscow. The girls around the “Iron Gates” were mad for him! After that, on the day he married Mendel Kotsov’s daughter – <i>Rickl di Lyalke</i> –Rickl the Doll – the whole town was drunk for eight days running! </p>

<p>When the young couple went for a stroll on the Sabbath in the central public garden or to the Eldorado Theatre, the other young women watched them with envious glances, wishing they had such luck.</p>

<p>Rickl the Doll was the neighborhood beauty. She was tall and slim, rosy-faced with long, chestnut-brown hair. Even then there had been talk of the Police Chief being so in love with her that he would follow her around in his carriage. Young men would fight over her with knives, while she looked down from her balcony in the market place, smiling upon them with her sparkling doll-like eyes.</p>

<p>Thus, the couple lived together for a few years. They had no children and their business grew more and more successful. The ‘street’ would murmur that they were living like true <i>magnaten </i>(aristocrats).</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, Folyeh suddenly became ill and began to lose his sight. Within a very short time, the illness drained him of his fortune. They sought out every professor, every doctor and every good Jew with a bright idea. But nothing helped! Nothing! </p>

<p>He began to be seen wandering in the market place with bandaged eyes. He seemed suddenly,overnight, to become old and thin, but he still possessed those mighty shoulders and a proud, highly-held head. Rickl the Doll would lead him by the arm. Folyeh could no longer carry on the business; nevertheless, by feel and touch he was still able to evaluate poultry.</p>

<p>The women of the town shed great, hot tears, watching Folyeh on the street, and people began to reproach Rickl the Doll: “Such a doll she is, that she can’t go into the market with some merchandise?”</p>

<p>But Rickl would not hear of doing business on the street. As before, she appeared on the street elegantly dressed and her haughtiness caused all heads to turn at her beauty.</p>

<p>As for Folyeh, things went from bad to worse. Good friends came round to support him, and gathered together a few rubles. Then he went into hospital for a long time. During this time, Rickl would leave the house and disappear at night. There was talk of her being seen in the far-away streets, amongst officers and generals. A good friend, who visited Folyeh in hospital, confided to him of his wife’s affairs. Folyeh heard him out, but remained silent.</p>

<p>He continued to hold his head up, but a certain air of tension could be observed about his person, a strange rigidity that crept in silently Then came that Sabbath evening —everyone was standing around their gates, couples were out strolling, when suddenly there was a great hullabaloo, people running every which way.</p>

<p>Folyeh appeared in the street wearing a long gray smock, with his eyes bandaged. He ran to and fro like a wild ox, roaring and bellowing, slippers on his bare feet. After him ran scores of people. He went up to the house where he lived. The door was locked.</p>

<p>Rickl the Doll was not at home. With one mighty blow, he threw open the door, felt his way around every corner and inhaled deeply through his nose, taking in everything, all the subtle scents of her clothing. He threw open the closet, approached the bed, and suddenly threw himself down with a roar, like a lion. And before anyone could stop him, he had made a complete shambles of the entire house. He broke down the closet, and tore up the bedclothes. The town’s ‘strong-arms’ were called in, but even they could barely contain him.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Let me at her! Give her to me, and I will tear off her head! Folyeh still lives!”</p>

<p>He went on cursing and mumbling like this, determined to stay until she came home. </p>

<p>His good friends embraced him and tried to convince him:</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Folyeh…let it go...forget her. God will help you…you’ll become a <i>mentsch</i> and find another doll.”</p>

<p>Folyeh became weak and began to shake and sob like a child. They say that all the men cried with him when they took him back to the hospital.</p>

<p>From that moment on, Rickl the Doll disappeared.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thus began a chain of darkness, the bleak years. In the beginning, some of the old dealers still remembered Folyeh. They would send over a basket of chickens for him to inspect. </p>

<p>This would enable him to earn a bit of money. The women would deliver a <i>lefl varems – </i>(a warm spoonful) – a bit of cooked food, to the <i>holyes</i>. Little by little, however, they soon forgot him altogether. </p>

<p>But blind Folyeh never forgot anyone. Even though his eyes remained in constant darkness, he always remembered – in his mind – the whole neighborhood of the “Iron Gates” and the market place. He recognized each step, every house, every fence and corner of the place, and certainly every person. With his stick clutched tightly in his gnarled outstretched hand, and with his wild, unruly hair, he mercilessly paced the crowded market place. The brightly moving world that he had lost, became even more internalized within him, astonishingly more vivid and clear in his recollection. He could recognize the voice of each and every person he had ever known.</p>

<p>Amidst the great clamor of the market, the loud cries and raucous noise of geese, hens, ducks, women, children, girls and many good Jews, Folyeh would arrive early every morning -- together with all the dealers, butchers, water-carriers and dray-men. Always tall and straight, with a massive, gray head – as if carved from wood – and a broad, pale mouth and white, solid healthy teeth, he came. </p>

<p>Only his eyes were closed and withdrawn. Small reddish slits appeared where once had been eyes. Blind Folyeh stands leaning on his stick, with pointed, alert ears and listens.</p>

<p>He passes a carrier, bent under a heavy load. Approaching the blind man, the town carrier shouts: “Good morning, Folyeh”. </p>

<p class="dialogue">“Good morning, Leibeleh comrade,” Foyleh responds to the man, as he strains under his heavy load.</p>

<p>Laughter is heard from the women and children. The carrier stops, still holding the large box on his back, and thrusts a coin into his hand, saying: “Here Folyeh – you deserve it –since you recognize me…”</p>

<p>Suddenly a carriage is heard rumbling over the pointed stones of the road towards Folyeh. Midst all the noise the wagon driver shouts down: “Folyeh…may the devil take your father…”</p>

<p class="dialogue">Blind Folyeh strains his ears, mumbles a moment, and throws out a cry: “Motkele Shemendik….toss me a tenner…”</p>

<p>And so he recognizes each and every one. He never makes a mistake. The crowd delights in him and throws him their spare change.</p>

<p>The older dealers speak sadly among themselves: “Look what a man can become…</p>

<p>If one only had what he once possessed. God punishes a person…”</p>

<p>Children with fingers in their amazed mouths look with fear upon the blind man, who mumbles with his mouth moving as though convincing himself of something.</p>

<p>All around the noise of the market resounds, selling and buying. Merchants praise their fine products to the skies. The clamor rolls on and on, like a hail of stones.</p>

<p>An elegant, stylishly dressed noblewoman has arrived to purchase goods, and they are beseeching her from all sides. A soldier holding a yellow lamp follows her with two large baskets. The <i>pritseh </i>(noblewoman) usually buys a great deal. She smiles graciously, her large, blue eyes shining. She knows that “they cheat here”....oh, she knows.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stick in the hand of the blind one begins to shake and rattle. His head turns sharply and is held high. He begins to walk in her direction, stumbling in his haste. He holds his hands high and bellows a wild shriek:</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Rickl, Rickl!…My wife Rickl!” </p>

<p>A thick crowd begins to gather, quickly clustering around them and old Foyleh’s entreaty echoes loudly, resounding throughout the market place. The noblewoman’s large eyes become suddenly wider – she swoons, in the midst of all, caught by the confused soldier, clutching his yellow lamp tightly.</p>
